</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MY <span class="smcap">Beloved Sex</span>:</p>

<p>I have taken upon myself a great
task, at the age of sixty-two, through
love for you and the rising generation.
The Scripture teaches,—<i>Where
much is given, much will be
required</i>; that is the case with me.
Nature’s gift was liberal, and this
gift I had ample means to cultivate.</p>

<p>I left Boston, my native place, and kind parents, at the age
of fifteen, for Montreal, there to acquire and master languages
which my native home could not bestow. Here I devoted
three years to French and Latin, as they were absolutely necessary
for my advancement in Philosophy and Botany. I remained
here some years, and frequently visited the Iroquois
tribe, learning much of them in the healing art.</p>

<p>I began to keep a regular manuscript of all I could possibly
learn from every tribe and nation, not allowing myself to be
biased by prejudice.</p>

<p>My beloved friends, daily do I read books that are styled
Herbal, on the Virtues of Roots, Herbs, &amp;c., and have not
only discovered in them an almost innumerable quantity of
errors and defects, but also a multiplicity of directions for
their uses which my own knowledge and practice proves ineffectual
in the cure of the complaints to which these treatisers
have directed their applications.</p>

<p>I likewise give you a description of the human body, or, in
a word, the Living Animal, easy and comprehensive, that it
may be understood by every one who reads it. I have written
it in a plain, easy and familiar style, adapted to all capacities.
It is the sincere wish of my heart, that it may prove a
blessing to all.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/w.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN conception first takes place,
an ovum is detached, which is
carried through the fallopian tubes
or oviduct, to the uterus, and has
been observed in that organ by Sir
E. Home, eight days after impregnation.</p>

<p>About the fourth week, it resembles
a tadpole, the appendage or
tail being probably the spinal marrow;
a small point is perceived below the head which pulsates
and indicates the region of the heart; below this the abdomen
appears. Thus, the brain, spinal marrow and heart are first
called into action, the other parts being brought forward as
required by nature.</p>

<p>About the sixth week, two small, black spots proclaim the
development of the eyes; the mouth appearing about the
same time; the upper and lower limbs soon become discernable.
The intestinal tube is perpendicular, running along the
spine.</p>

<p>At two months, all parts of the child are present; the eyes
and eyebrows are visible; the limbs are developed; the fingers
are closed on each other, though flimsy; the head now forms
comparatively the third part of the body, in size. Its weight
is about half an ounce, and length about three inches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<p>Between the ninth and tenth weeks, the mouth is plainly
defined, the lips drawn closely together; the eyelids close the
eyes; the opening of the ears begin to appear; the spinal
tail shortens, and the fingers and toes assume their proper
shape and position.</p>

<p>Towards the third month, the face is distinct; the front part
of the chest is covered in by the iternum; the intestines,
hitherto contained in the umbilical cord, enter the abdomen;
the skin begins to be organized; the embryo is now from four
to six inches in length, and weighs from one and a half to two
ounces.</p>

<p>At the fourth month, the upper and lower extremities are
equal; the skin is downy; the bones and muscles are so far
formed as to be under the control of, and are now moved by the
fœtus. It measures about seven or eight inches in length, and
weighs between seven to eight ounces.</p>

<p>About the fifth month, the auricles and vesicles of the
heart are equal; the toe and finger nails are marked; the
skin is still red; the features become plainly developed. The
length of the fœtus is ten inches, and the weight about sixteen
ounces.</p>

<p>At the sixth month, the hair appears; the brain becomes
homogeneous; the nails may be plainly distinguished; the
form of the child is now distinct. The length twelve inches,
and the weight nearly two pounds.</p>

<p>At the seventh month, the skin is of a rosy color, cellular
substance becomes developed; the eyelids are covered; the
bile is bitter; every part of the fœtus is enlarged, and so far
developed that if born at this time it will be able to breathe,
cry and nurse, but very difficult to raise, or bring up, requiring,
as it does, a great amount of care, and constant attention.
Lacking animal heat, it must be imparted to it by being kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
wrapt in a soft, flannel blanket, and in the lap of the nurse, or
lay close to its mother, as its own power of generating heat is
very feeble, therefore that heat necessary to its existence must
be supplied to it. It is very seldom they are strong enough,
bodily or constitutionally, to endure washing or dressing.
Natural, or animal heat, is far preferable to fire heat. The
length of the body fourteen inches, and weight about three
pounds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_006_facing.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"> Plate 2.</div>
</div>

<p>At the eighth month, all the parts are more developed; the
infant measures sixteen inches, and weighs between four and
five pounds.</p>

<p>At the ninth month, the infant has acquired the perfect
form of the human species; the two substances of the brain
are quite distinct; the muscular system well developed, the
bones are strong, the motions of the child quick and lively,
the heart pulsates rapidly, and the circulation has become
very active. The length of the body is generally twenty
inches, and the weight seven or eight pounds; the crown of
woman’s bliss&mdash;the true effects of wedded love.</p>

<h2 id="PERIOD_OF_GESTATION">PERIOD OF GESTATION.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE usual period of gestation, (carrying
the child in the womb,) as derived
from extended observation by medical
statisticians, is found to be forty
weeks, or 280 days. Ladies generally
count nine solar months, which is a little
short of 280 days. The difficulty of determining
from which particular act of cohabitation
conception took place, and still
more, the impossibility of knowing on what
day the semen of the male impregnated
the ovum of the female, (as this may not occur
for some days after copulation,) renders certainty
upon the length of gestation, to a day, quite out of the question
in any case. But by close observation, and taking a great
number of cases, it may be ascertained, to within a brief
period, when conception has occurred, and from thence the
average deduction of gestation may be drawn. But upon this
point, as upon all others connected with the subject of gestation,
it will be found that there is no fixed period for parturition to
take place. It may occur before the expiration of 280 days;
it may not happen till after that period. There have been
undoubted instances where gestation has been prolonged to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
300 days. The law of France fixes 300 days as the period,
after death, or absence of the husband, wherein the child shall
be considered legitimate. In Scotland, the term is ten
months. In one case in this country, a child born 311 days
after the decease of the husband, was decided by the Court to
be legitimate; but physiologists would be dubious upon the
legitimacy of the infant in a case so prolongated as this.</p>

<p>On the other hand, children are often born before the expiration
of the 280 days. Seven and eight months’ children,
that live, are by no means uncommon; and there have been
recorded cases of children born at even so short a period as
twenty-four weeks after conception, which lived; the child
itself, from the formation and ossification it presented, giving
evidence that it had not been a longer period than that in the
womb. A Church Court, in England, decided a child legitimate
born twenty-seven weeks after marriage. In cases of
this kind, the child itself is the best evidence; the appearance
it presents showing, to the medical man, generally, very
near its fœtal age. There are so many instances recorded,
and well attested cases, where children have been born at a
much less time, after conception, than nine months, that no
woman should be accused or suspected of wrong in giving
birth to a child a little short of the usual period, after
marriage. It is exceedingly unjust to do so. The mortification
which many sensitive ladies, entirely innocent of
evil, experience, and the mental anguish they endure from
such thoughtless remarks as the ignorant, upon these points,
are too prone to make, leads me to hope that men and women
will hereafter better inform themselves upon this subject, and
from a better knowledge be induced to abstain from unjust
conversation and condemnation.</p>

<h3>THOROUGHWORT</h3>

<p>Has been introduced extensively into practice throughout
the United States, and appears to be superior to camomile as
a sudorific tonic, and far preferable to bark, in the treatment
of the local autumnal fevers of the country, prevalent near
the streams, lakes and marshes, often curing when other
tonics failed. A warm decoction of boneset, till it vomits
freely, is generally sufficient to break up almost any fever in
its commencement; it cleanses the stomach, and excites the
secretive organs; relaxes constriction, produces a free perspiration,
and, of course, throws off the disease. For colds, it is
a complete remedy, always observing to take a draught of the
cold tea after the sweat is over, which will prevent an additional
cold on exposure.</p>

<p>Boneset may be managed to act as a tonic, a sudorific, a
laxative, or an emetic.</p>


<h3>PEACH LEAVES AND TWIGS</h3>

<p>Are useful in a bad cough. Steeped down to a strong tea,
with about half of the quantity of skunk-cabbage, add the
same quantity of good molasses as there is of tea, and take
half a wineglass three or four times a day. I have cured an
obstinate cough with this medicine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>Peach pits, or meats, are very useful in bitters to assist the
digestive organs, and prevent inflammation of the kidneys
and bladder. The leaves and twigs have the same properties
as the meats, and will answer when the meats cannot be
obtained. A strong tea made of peach leaves, will stop
excessive vomiting.</p>


<h3>BALMORRY, OR SNAKEHEAD.</h3>

<p>This herb is found in moist fields, frequently near small
streams or rivulets, and has a very bitter taste. It is much
used for bitters; for correcting the bile, it is a tonic and anti-bilious,
much used in jaundice, dyspepsia, loss of appetite,
general languor and debility; good for children troubled with
worms. It is one of the ingredients in my spiced bitters. An
even teaspoonful of the powder is a dose.</p>


<h3>ANGELICA</h3>

<p>Is found in all parts of the United States. Its medical
properties are the same as the garden angelica of Europe.</p>


<h3>SUMMER SAVORY,</h3>

<p>An annual plant, growing without cultivation in the south
of Europe; is cultivated in our gardens; principally used to
season food. It is stimulant, and has a tendency to remove
pain and wind.</p>


<h3>PRICKLY ASH.</h3>

<p>The bark and berries of the prickly ash are stimulant, tonic,
and energetic. It has been highly esteemed as a remedy for
chronic rheumatism, and is a celebrated remedy for the
toothache; a very common ingredient in bitters; it possesses
somewhat the properties of guaiacum. By a long continuance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
in taking this bark, it is said to produce salivation. The dose
to be taken is from ten grains to half a drachm, to be repeated
three or four times a day.</p>


<h3>EVERGREEN, OR WINTERGREEN.</h3>

<p>An excellent remedy for cleansing the blood. The oil is
good for the toothache, and is used to disguise many popular
panaceas.</p>


<h3>ROSE.</h3>

<p>The flower is tonic and astringent. Dr. Beach prescribes
the rose water in connection with the pith of young sassafras
twigs, in ophthalmia, or inflammation of the eyes.</p>


<h3>PENNYROYAL.</h3>

<p>Found all over the United States, and in Canada. It is
gently stimulant, produces universal perspiration when taken
in large quantities, warm, and we consider it the best drink to
accompany the lobelia emetic. In cases of sudden suppression
of the menses, a tumblerful of this drink, with an even
teaspoonful of black pepper, powdered fine, sweetened and
drank warm, after soaking the feet in weak ley, will rarely fail
producing the desired effect. It is useful to qualify, or mix
other medicines for sickness at the stomach, colds, &amp;c., and
may be drank freely.</p>


<h3>BLUE FLAG.</h3>

<p>Found throughout the United States, by the side of streams
and wet places. It flowers in June, has a very handsome blue
flower; grows about two feet high. The Oneida Indians
make much use of this root for the cure of rheumatism.
Make a strong tincture of the blue flag root, by putting it
into spirits, or alcohol; let the patient take a teaspoonful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
three times a day, after eating, increasing the dose gradually.
If it should produce slight pains in the head and breast, take
less at a time.</p>


<h3>BEGGAR LICE.</h3>

<p>The virtues of this plant has never, to my knowledge, been
thoroughly understood. As a nervine in all female difficulties,
and a valuable medicine when used for any derangement
in the monthly courses, it has not many equals; it will remove
pain immediately, and quiet the nerves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Directions.</span>&mdash;Take a handful of the flowers and leaves,
and half the quantity of tanzy; make a good strong tea, and
take a quantity on going to bed, if you can; if not, take it,
but do not go out in the cold. The best time is bed time.</p>


<h3>SINGLE-CELLED BERRY.</h3>

<p>Grows in hedges, and along the road sides, in almost every
part of America; flowers in July and August; the berry
contains three irregular shaped seeds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medical Virtues.</span>&mdash;A decoction of the berries and roots,
has been found most efficacious in curing dropsies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;Boil two ounces of the dry root, in two
quarts of rain water, down to one half, and strain the liquor.
In dropsy, a gill of the decoction must be taken morning
and night. A gill of the juice made from the inner, or green
bark, works powerfully, both upwards and downwards, and
has frequently cured dropsies. One ounce of the inner bark,
dried, and one ounce of the dry roots, may be boiled in four
quarts of rain water, down to two quarts; a teacupful, taken
three times a day, works powerfully as a diuretic, and is an
excellent remedy in suppression of the urine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>


<h3>DRAGON’S CLAW, OR FEVER ROOT.</h3>

<p>This is a newly discovered plant, known to but few botanists
in the United States. It rises six or seven feet; the leaves
grow in a cluster from the root to the top; blossoms, yellow;
roots, small and black, about the size of cloves, and very
tender, very much resembling the claws of an animal, and so
full of nitre that the powder of the root, if kept in the open
air, will liquify.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">History.</span>&mdash;This plant grows upon mountains and the sides
of hills, in the Genesee country, and about Albany: the leaves
ovate, and are two or three inches long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medical Virtues.</span>&mdash;It is a powerful febrifuge, and I have
found it a sure and quick medicine in exciting perspiration,
without increasing the heat of the body. The root is effectual
in all remittent, typhus, and nervous fevers, and will
relieve the patient of all pains caused by colds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;After prescribing a mild puke of the
American ipecacuanha, and the physic has done working, I
give one or two ounces of the root, to be put into two quarts
of rain water, and boiled down to one, and giving the patient,
in bed, a teacupful of the strained liquor every hour, which
causes a plentiful perspiration, and generally stops the fever in
a few hours. The night-hectic fever, in a consumptive
patient, I have relieved by the above treatment. It is an excellent
medicine in pleurisy, and a sure remedy in erysipelatose
fever.</p>

<p>Pulverize the root, sift the powder through a fine hair
sieve, and put it in bottles, well stopped from the air. A teaspoonful
of this powder may be taken every two hours, in a
teacupful of black snakeroot tea, in order to raise a speedy
diaphoresis, or perspiration, in pleurisies and fever, when they
are violent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>


<h3>BLACK ALDER</h3>

<p>Rises to the height of a small tree, and is much branched
towards the top; the young shoots are full of pith&mdash;the old
ones empty; the leaves are pinnated, consisting of two or
three pair, with an odd one at the end; flowers, sweet smelling,
white, and produced on large, flat umbels, or clusters.
The fruit is a round, succulent berry, of a blackish purple
color, and contains three seeds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">History.</span>&mdash;This tree grows in hedges and clumps, along
the borders of meadows or flats, in every part of the United
States; flowers in July, and the berries are ripe in September.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medical Virtues.</span>&mdash;An infusion, in wine, of the inner
bark of the trunk, or the expressed juice of the berries, in a
dose of an ounce, will purge moderately, and, taken in small
doses,&mdash;say a teaspoonful every hour,&mdash;proves an efficacious
diabetruent, capable of promoting and assisting all the fluid
secretions. The following is a good medicine in families, for
the cure of recent colds and coughs:—</p>

<p>Take of the juice of elderberries, strained, ten pounds, and
add three pounds of loaf sugar; evaporate in a bake pan,
over a slow fire, into the consistence of thick honey. A tablespoonful
or two may be taken at bed time; and two teaspoonsful,
for children, in coughs and costiveness, will prove
effectual.</p>

<p>In erysipelatosed fever, a teacupful of the infusion of dry
flowers, (made by pouring a quart of boiling water on a handful
of the flowers,) may be taken every hour, and the parts
wet with the following wash:&mdash;Boil four ounces of beech
drops, in four quarts of rain water, down to one half; strain
the decoction, and add to it a teaspoonful of sugar of lead.
The face and arms may be wet with a linen rag, dipped in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
lotion, four or five times a day, which never fails to cure, after
necessary evacuations.</p>

<p>The above is also very good for children having the <a id="whooping17"></a>whooping
cough, by taking a teaspoonful or two every hour.</p>


<h3>SOUTHERN WOOD, OR OLD MAN.</h3>

<p>There are few who are ignorant of the existence of this
plant, or unacquainted with its aromatic fragrance. It is to
be found in almost every garden; flowers of a lilac-tinged,
grayish color.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medical Properties.</span>&mdash;There are very few who really
know how useful this plant is. It is stimulant, sudorific, antiseptic,
anti-hysterical, and, I consider it, a great nervine. It
is an excellent remedy for the headache, and to check a too
profuse flow of the menses; is also good for worms.</p>


<h3>BLACK MUSTARD SEED.</h3>

<p>Take a handful, pound and mix with rye meal; good for
pains in the chest, or elsewhere. Mix with water only; put
the poultice on the soles of the feet.</p>


<h3>WHITE MUSTARD SEED.</h3>

<p>Very little known; it is a valuable medicine,&mdash;simple and
efficacious in all cases where the stomach is weakened by
taking too much medicine; it creates warmth in the stomach,
that is, it expels wind and removes that cold mucous from the
stomach, assisting the digestive organs in their functions, and
creates a regular appetite. I have found it good for worms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Directions.</span>&mdash;Take two large tablespoonsful of seeds,
clean and free from dirt, and put them into a half teacupful
of spearmint tea; take a teaspoonful morning, noon, and bed
time. Keep the decoction covered close, and should they be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>come
dry, add more tea. You must not chew them, but
swallow them whole. Follow this treatment for fifteen days
in succession. Give less to a child, in proportion to age and
constitution, sweetened with sugar or molasses.</p>


<h3>CATNIP.</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding this plant is but little thought of in
regular practice, it is a very valuable herb. I have used it,
with motherwort, for menstruation, and found it gave relief
instantly, especially where they were swollen or bloated. I
have often used it successfully in treating children in cases of
fits, caused by worms. Make a half pint of strong, catnip
tea, add an even teaspoonful of fine salt, two or three tablespoonsful
of molasses, one tablespoonful of sweet oil, or hog’s
lard; inject two-thirds of it, and keep it up ten or fifteen
minutes, which may be done by compressing the parts with
the hand. It will bring away the super-abundance of mucous
slime which, in such cases, collects on the internal surface of
the intestinal canal.</p>

<p>Catnip tea is very useful in fevers, producing perspiration
without increasing the heat of the body; it is also an excellent
remedy in spasmodic affections. I have used it instead
of pennyroyal for an emetic; but I prefer pennyroyal in all
cases where a vegetable emetic is to be given.</p>


<h3>GARDEN LEAK.</h3>

<p>Though having a very offensive smell, is good for the gravel
and all diseases of the urinary organs.</p>


<h3>JACOB’S LADDER.</h3>

<p>Good for retention of the urine, pain in the back, loins, &amp;c.;
can be taken as a tea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>


<h3>UVA URSA LEAVES</h3>

<p>Are excellent for consumptive persons, and, I would say,
drink plentifully of the tea, by steeping it well; add a little
licorice root.</p>


<h3>SPEARMINT</h3>

<p>Is a native of the States. It is warming and exhilarating
in its nature, and has all the properties of the peppermint,
but works more on the kidneys, and causes a copious flow of
urine and perspiration.</p>


<h3>MASTERWORT.</h3>

<p>The roots and seeds are aromatic, expectorant and laxative;
they are good to promote menstrual discharge. I can highly
recommend it to all who are troubled with cholic and flatulent
disorders; it helps digestion, and warms the stomach.</p>


<h3>MARSH ROSE MOSS.</h3>

<p>This I have used successfully in cases of gleet and gonorrhœa;
use a decoction made from the roots.</p>


<h3>SUCCORY.</h3>

<p>This plant grows wild, and is generally found in pastures;
has long leaves, with a rib down the middle; very bitter.
The wild succory is the strongest, and I generally prefer it in
my practice. It is laxative, and excellent in fevers, cutaneous
eruptions, and weak bowels.</p>


<h3>BLACK SNAKE ROOT.</h3>

<p>This root is diaphoretic, very warming, and promotes perspiration;
in a word, it is a strengthening cordial for all
feeble persons. Steep it and sweeten with sugar; good as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
drink in all fevers; its use will prevent mortification in a
fractured limb.</p>


<h3>WILD POPLAR BARK.</h3>

<p>A great tonic, as well as a pleasant bitter; valuable, and
far superior to peruvian bark for intermittent fever. Take it
when the fever is off.</p>

<p>Put a handful of the inner bark in a quart of luke-warm
water, and let it stand a few hours; take a wineglassful in the
morning, at noon, and at bed time.</p>


<h3>DANDELION.</h3>

<p>The roots and leaves are opening, cleansing the liver and
gall; it opens all the secretions of the viscera, cleanses the
blood, and is good in fevers and general debility.</p>


<h3>VERVAIN.</h3>

<p>This herb is good for headaches. Steep in good vinegar,
and bind on externally.</p>


<h3>CROSSWORT.</h3>

<p>This herb is excellent in all bowel complaints, and is a good
drink with your meals. The Shakers use this instead of tea
and coffee; it makes a very pleasant drink when made weak;
boil, or steep it in hot water, ten minutes, in order to make it
palatable.</p>


<h3>FUMITORY</h3>

<p>Is an excellent herb, and makes a good, pleasant tea; is
cooling; good for humors, and all cutaneous eruptions of
the skin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>


<h3>QUEEN OF THE MEADOW.</h3>

<p>Leaves and flowers possess the same virtues. It is very
seldom used by females in the United States. This herb
should be in every collection; an excellent regulator in all
urinary difficulties, where the evacuations are scant, or too
profuse; strengthens the kidneys and bladder.</p>


<h3>BITTER ROOT, OR AMERICAN IPECACUANHA.</h3>

<p>Grows in wood bogs, and on low, sandy land; is emetic, and
an excellent hydragogue, causing the water to pass off freely;
is diaphoretic, possessing the same virtues as the English
Ipecacuanha, but I prefer it as it is rather milder. It is the
bitterest root we have it Botany. In another part of this
book may be found a recipe for making the tincture. When
properly administered, it is good in almost all ailments.</p>


<h3>LOBELIA,</h3>

<p>Sometimes called “emetic weed,” or “Indian tobacco.”
I have used this herb with success; not sufficient to cause
vomiting, but merely to loosen the phlegm and the gall cakes,
or gall stones, which are formed by inward heat. It will act
as an emetic and diaphoretic, but always have some balsamic
herb with it, when used as such.</p>

<p>I have found it excellent in asthmas, <a id="whooping21"></a>whooping cough, and
phthisic. Take the seeds, mandrake root, and blood root,
equal parts of each, say 2 oz., and put them into a quart of
good rum or whiskey; add a teaspoonful of coriander seeds,
pulverized fine; let them stand ten hours near the fire, shaking
often; give a half teaspoonful in sweetened water; give
six to ten drops to a child having the rattles, or croup; it will
loosen colds immediately, and act beneficially on the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
system. Keep this herb always at hand; do not be afraid of
it; give a little at a time, until relieved; I have saved the
lives of hundreds with it. In severe cases, put boiled, or
bruised onions on the soles of the feet, and, likewise, take a
half teaspoonful of spirits turpentine, added to a tablespoonful
of goose grease, or hen’s oil, and rub it in briskly between
the shoulders and on the breast; repeat often if necessary,
but this will not be required except in very severe cases.
Lobelia is also good to smoke for asthma.</p>


<h3>RED RASPBERRY.</h3>

<p>The leaves are the only part of this that is used in practice,
although the berries are very healthy in their season.
I have used the leaves in combination with those of mullen,
for canker, dysentery, diarrhœa, and sore mouth, both in
adults and babes; it heals and removes all canker from the
bowels. Let the patient drink plentifully of it.</p>


<h3>HOPS.</h3>

<p>Narcotic, but very useful in poultices; they are good for
pain in the bowels and intestines, and in falling of the womb.
Steep hops in whiskey, heat them hot, and spread on a cotton
cloth, sprinkle on a little black pepper, and apply to the
abdomen. Drink a strong tea made of hops, at bed time, for
nine nights in succession. A pillow made of hops is excellent
for persons having weak nerves, and is far healthier than
feathers; so, also, is sweet fern.</p>


<h3>MAIDEN HAIR.</h3>

<p>This herb is pectoral and vermifuge; an excellent remedy
in coughs, and for all female complaints,&mdash;general debility,
&amp;c. For a cough, take a handful, the same of upper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
mullen leaves, a half handful hoarhound, three cents’ worth
licorice; put these into one quart of water and boil six minutes,
then strain, adding two teaspoonsful cider vinegar and
half pound of honey. Take a tablespoonful every time the
cough is troublesome.</p>


<h3>HUCKLEBERRY, OR WHORTLEBERRY.</h3>

<p>This berry is very beneficial in retention of the urine, and
derangements of the kidneys and bladder. Make a tea of it,
and use as occasion requires.</p>


<h3>FIR BALSAM.</h3>

<p>This balsam grows mostly in Maine. I can highly recommend
it in coughs, for which take a little on sugar. For sore
breast, anoint the nipples every night on going to bed, or,
it may be used during the day, though I prefer the former.
It is good for all kinds of sores, and may be used internally
and externally, without danger, being simple and efficacious.</p>


<h3>CAMOMILE.</h3>

<p>For pain in the side, take the flowers, pulverize, and mix
with honey and sweet oil; good in agues, swellings, shrunk
sinews, and in colic, jaundice, bilious colic, and gravel.</p>


<h3>CARROT SEED.</h3>

<p>Good for wind, and as an assister in monthly courses. The
leaves, pounded, are good for sores and ulcers; the juice of
the root is excellent in salves, as it is both cleansing and
healing.</p>


<h3>CARAWAY SEED.</h3>

<p>May be effectually used for retention of urine, and for wind;
also, in poultices for bruises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>


<h3>CELANDINE.</h3>

<p>Boil in rain water until the strength is out, then mix with
old rum, is excellent for sore eyes; for film on the eye, make
a salve with it and fresh butter; or, the juice may be squeezed
into the eye, and for the same purpose, it can be mixed
with breast milk.</p>

<p>A decoction, in wine, is good for jaundice; the root is good
for dropsy, and when powdered and put into a hollow tooth
will stop the toothache. The leaves, made into a tea, are
good for a sweat, to be taken on going to bed; for a fever, if
taken in its early stages, and as a component part in ointments.</p>


<h3>PILLWORT.</h3>

<p>This is a smaller species of Celandine and is highly recommended
as a wash, or ointment, for king’s evil.</p>


<h3>CRANESBILL.</h3>

<p>Excellent for bilious colic, gravel, and soreness of the stomach
and lungs. The leaves, pounded and scalded, are good
to cleanse and heal sores and fresh wounds; and wet in rum
or hot vinegar, makes a good outward application for rheumatism.</p>


<h3>DWARF ALDER.</h3>

<p>A tea, made of the inner or middle bark, is good for dropsy,
for coughs, and for affections of chest and lungs. The leaves
are good for inflammation of the eyes. The juice of the
berry, boiled in honey, and a few drops put in the ear, will
stop the earache or headache. A tea, made from the roots,
will assist the monthly courses, and remove obstructions; is
also good to bathe the head when affected by cold. A tea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
made from the blossoms, I recommend in retention of urine,
for the piles, and to cleanse the blood. Striping the bark <i>up</i>,
it will act as an emetic,—<i>down</i>, as a physic.</p>


<h3>SLIPPERY ELM.</h3>

<p>The bark from the root, scraped fine, relieves swellings,
inflammations, and contracted sinews; the root should be
boiled some hours, skimmed and allowed to cool. A poultice,
made of the bark from the root, boiled one hour and strained,
is good for bald head, and will make the hair grow; also, an
excellent application for burns, scalds, and inflammations,
inwardly or outwardly.</p>


<h3>ELECAMPANE.</h3>

<p>This is one of the best roots we have in coughs and consumption,
or phthisic, when used as a syrup. It is good for
the teeth, preventing their aching and decaying; good as an
ointment for the itch, and, used with tobacco, is good for all
kinds of sores. The tops, made into beer, are good for the
sight, cramps, convulsions, spitting of blood, &amp;c.</p>


<h3>WHITE BRYONY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Description.</span>&mdash;The stem of this plant twists around bushes,
shrubs and trees, and shoots out to a great extent; its tendril
leaves are very large, diminishing gradually to the top
one; palmated lobes, pointed irregularly, and standing upon
long foot-stalks; flowers of a yellow green, male and female,
and from the alaæ of the leaves, which are striped with green
veins, turns into a red berry. It grows in low meadows and
swamps; the roots are white and large.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medical Properties.</span>&mdash;The root is a powerful drastic purgative;
it was formerly much used by the celebrated Dr.
Sydenham as a hydragogue purge in dropsies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Directions.</span>&mdash;In all dropsical swellings and suppressions
of urine, the patient may take 2 to 3 drachms, which will
work sufficient without griping; take soup as a drink.</p>


<h3>VIRGIN’S BOWER.</h3>

<p>This plant rises about two feet in hight; the petals white;
the seeds are attached to their stamens, giving them the appearance
of feathered tails.</p>


<h3>MILK, OR SILK WEED.</h3>

<p>This has a square stalk, and rises three feet in hight; flowers
yellow, which terminate in a pod.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medical Virtues.</span>&mdash;The root has been found effectual in
the cure of dropsy. I have used it with success in all dropsical
cases.</p>


<h3>MILKWEED</h3>

<p>Is also an excellent vermifuge for children. I have found
it good in catarrhal, cachectic, scrofulous and rheumatic
disorders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;You can steep it as a tea; (I only use the
roots) make it strong, according to age. When it is used for
suppression of the urine, drink plentifully; if for worms, give
it night and morning to children, sweetened with molasses.</p>


<h3>SASSAFRAS BARK.</h3>

<p>This is well known to all mankind, and grows plentifully in
the United States. I would say, as to the medical virtues of
this bark, it is Sudorific, diuretic, warming and stimulating,
and very little should be used at a time. There are very
many who chew it for a sweet breath, but it injures the habits,
therefore be careful, use it for it is good, and take a little at a
time, and not too much; it cleanses the blood.</p>

<h3>SARSAPARILLA ROOT.</h3>

<p>This root is so well known to every individual that I deem
it little to the purpose to say much about it; it is alterative
in its properties, and more dependence has been put on its
virtues than really could be relied on as a cure; but mixed
with other roots of the same virtues, has always been found
by me the best for all tumors, scrofulas, or venereal diseases.
I think snakehead, or fisherworth, can be relied on for more
virtue than sarsaparilla; but even if you have confidence in
this root alone, I say make a decoction, or tea from it, strong.
I prefer our own American sarsaparilla to the Spanish, and
as a rule, prefer all roots, barks, berries, &amp;c., from our own
native soil.</p>


<h3>MAY WEED.</h3>

<p>This weed is well known to all; it resembles camomile, and
is called by some, wild camomile. It has a very disagreeable
smell and taste; although little used in practice, I consider it
very useful in dysenteries or chronic disorders; it will instantly
give relief in bloody flux and flooding; is Sudorific. If you
have a case, and need a good sweat, drink a pint of tea made
by steeping the weed.</p>


<h3>CANADA SNAKE ROOT.</h3>

<p>Very heating; has a beautiful smell; is stimulating, and
excellent for the aged, and for all persons of cold or phlegmatic
temperaments.</p>


<h3>COHOSH ROOT.</h3>

<p>There are four kinds of cohosh,&mdash;white, blue, red and
black,&mdash;all possessing the same virtues. They are all diobstruents,
sedative and tonic. As a general medicine for females,
use the white and blue; the black, years past, was considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
a great remedy for rheumatism, and I have found it so myself.
Take equal parts of cohosh and prickley ash, and a very little
mandrake, is good for aged persons.</p>


<h3>BETH, OR PAPPOOSE ROOT.</h3>

<p>This root is generally known; is good in falling of the
womb, and troubles in the ovaries. Add it in every syrup
you make for diseases of females.</p>


<h3>SWEET FERN,</h3>

<p>Boiled in milk, is good for the dysentery and rickets.</p>


<h3>NETTLES.</h3>

<p>A tea made of nettles relieves stich in the side and back.</p>


<h3>BLOOD ROOT, OR DRAGON’S CLAW.</h3>

<p>This is one of the most useful roots we have, and no one
should be without it; it is emetic, cathartic, pectoral and
sudorific; in fact, it possesses many virtues; it will cure all
internal and external ulcers.</p>


<h3>BURDOCK ROOT.</h3>

<p>The roots and tops are of the same medical properties,
although we use the roots more in syrups than the leaves.
The roots I consider of a cleansing and detergent quality,
promotes sweat, is good in almost all syrups, and more especially
for females in the decline of life.</p>


<h3>INDIAN TURNIP.</h3>

<p>This root is very acrid, pungent and heating; it promotes
the watery excretions; its use quickens the circulation in
individuals of cold or phlegmatic habits. For a cough, take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
a tablespoonful of the root, pulverized, to which add two tablespoonsful
of pulverized loaf sugar, and a teaspoonful of flour
of sulphur; mix well together, and put it into a jar, covered
close. Take half teaspoonful five times a day. This will
cure your cough, and quicken the action of the digestive
organs. Take a green piece of this root, mixed with blue
flag, pound them both together, and it will cure a fellon, on
the finger or elsewhere. Apply three times.</p>


<h3>UNICORN ROOT.</h3>

<p>It grows on the side of mountains and frequently in swamps;
I have found it very strengthening in all female weaknesses.
Combined with white cohosh, an ounce of each, put into one
quart of wine, I have found good for hysteria cholic. Take
half a wine glass full at morning and at bed time.</p>


<h3>SNAKEWEED.</h3>

<p>This is certainly the most astringent that grows. Great
care must be taken when using it, and give a cathartic if it
proves too binding. It can be used with honey as a wash for
sore mouths.</p>


<h3>POKE ROOT, OR PIGEON BERRY.</h3>

<p>Few country people are unacquainted with this root.
Many persons use it for greens in the spring. Every one
should be prudent, and not use it too freely as it is emetic
and cathartic; it will vomit severely when taken in large doses,
but when used with moderation it will purify the blood, and
is an excellent remedy for inflammatory rheumatism, for
which cut the root into slices and apply it on all parts of the
body which are affected. For internal use, take one quart
of the berries and half an ounce of mandrake root, in two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
quarts of whiskey, and add two ounces of prickley ash bark;
drink a wine glass full in the same quantity of cold water,
mornings and at bed time; begin with half a wine glass at
first. It will be found good for males or females. In hysterics
or fits, it will give instant relief.</p>


<h3>SCOKE ROOT.</h3>

<p>This root is very different from poke root, and grows in
swamps; is very hard to dig, and is called by some white
hellebore; is a great nervine. I have known many put it
into snuff, but it is very harsh; it has been used by many in
case of mania, but as I do not recommend any poisons, would
say to all, let it alone. If you have the seven years’ itch, you
may add a little of it to the following wash: Take 2 ounces
of pulverized blood root, in 2 quarts of best cider vinegar, and
add quarter of an ounce of scoke root; shake well, and wash
all over at bed time. Let this wash stand near the fire for
several days before using it, shaking it frequently. When
too thick, add more vinegar. Do not shake it when you
wash with it, but turn it off clear.</p>


<h3>WATER FENNEL.</h3>

<p>This is anti-scrofulous; is excellent for all diseases of the
lungs, internal ulcers and asthma; it will remove the mucus
from the bronchial tubes, and heal them; for ulcers or sore
legs, drink it freely, and wash the sores with the same; add
a little white maple bark with it; always use the inner bark,
next to the wood.</p>


<h3>MARSH MALLOW.</h3>

<p>These grow in our gardens; the low mallow possesses the
same medical virtues; are both good in canker, mild and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
loosening; for canker in children add a little catnip and coriander
seed. Children have more or less canker in the bowels.</p>


<h3>WHITE OAK.</h3>

<p>This bark is very strengthening; and so, also, is the black
and yellow oak. They are good to make washes. I use
them internally, as I think them as good as peruvian bark,
and safer.</p>


<h3>OATS.</h3>

<p>How few there are acquainted with the virtues hid in oats.
Very many lives have been saved by using oat meal gruel,
but of late years it is entirely laid aside. Oats are healing
and cooling, and, therefore, healthy. Make puddings of the
meal for your children every night, and they will be healthy
and robust. Boil two quarts of oats in two gallons of
water four hours, add a handfull of succory, let it steep ten
hours, then strain off and add one pint of good molasses;
boil half an hour, and drink, say a tumbler half full, night
and morning, before dog days, and through that season. I
will warrant no sickness will trouble you. It will cleanse the
kidneys. Oats are good in pleurisies, and removes all obstructions
from the viscera. Take two vegetable pills at bed time.</p>


<h3>GOLDEN ROD.</h3>

<p>This plant is perennial, rises two feet in hight, has small
brown stalks divided at the top into branches with numerous
long green leaves; flowers small and yellow. It grows in
woods and meadows, and along the fences; its leaves are
gently astringent; the flowers are beneficial in removing
obstructions in the urinary organs, and in gravelly complaints
of the bladder; also, good in cachexies, and in the first stage
of dropsy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>


<h3>PARSLEY.</h3>

<p>Every person is acquainted with this plant, as it is found
in all gardens; it will produce a free discharge of urine; its
medical properties are cooling.</p>


<h3>GOLDEN SEAL.</h3>

<p>Is tonic, cathartic and nervine; excellent to wash sore eyes.</p>


<h3>ICE PLANT.</h3>

<p>This root is an excellent remedy for fits in children, and in
old times was called “fits root.”</p>


<h3>STONE ROOT.</h3>

<p>Grows on the side of hills; the root is knotty and nearly
as hard as a stone; this root is warming, diuretic, aromatic,
and good in all dropsical diseases.</p>


<h3>BUCKTHORN.</h3>

<p>Is a prickly bush, or low tree, grows in hedges throughout
the States. The bark and berries are cathartic, and if you
are in want of a brisk cathartic take the bark or berries. It
would be a good plan to put the berries into whiskey, and
take occasionally one or two tablespoonsful.</p>


<h3>WORMWOOD.</h3>

<p>This perennial herb grows by the road side, in gardens,
and around old ruins and walls. Its active constituents are a
bitter extract and essential oil; is used in stomach complaints,
and is of great service in hypochondria and melancholy, lowness
of spirits, and loss of appetite; in intermittent fevers,
cachectic, and dropsical complaints, and in jaundice; destroys
worms. The essence, taken for a considerable time, prevents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
the formation of stone in the kidneys and bladder,&mdash;the patient
omitting the use of wine and acids. The gout has been conquered
by the continual use of the decoction of this herb.
A teacupfull of the infusion taken twice a day, by nurses,
will make their milk good.</p>


<h3>WATER TREFOIL.</h3>

<p>This plant is perennial, and grows in marshes, swamps, and
wet meadows, in New Jersey. It flowers in July; the leaves
are excessively bitter, which is extracted by infusion; one
ounce of the leaves, dried, are equal to half a pound of hops,
in brewing. A drachm of the powdered leaves is a purge
and a vomit. It has been found beneficial in curing scorbutic
complaints, as well as tertian and quartan fevers, and is excellent
in curing rheumatic affections.</p>


<h3>POND LILY.</h3>

<p>The white and yellow both have the same properties, and
are healing and cooling. I have found them to relieve all
fluxes, inflammations, outwardly and inwardly. I use the
seeds and roots in cases of consumption. The blows make a
good poultice for burns, bruises, or any kind of sores, as it is
very healing.</p>


<h3>MADDER.</h3>

<p>This is opening and strengthening, and is a sure cure for
yellow jaundice: Take as much madder as you can hold in a
tablespoon, twice as much hoarhound, and snakehead, and
half an ounce of mandrake; put this into three pints of boiling
water, keep it warm ten hours, then strain, and add three
tablespoonsful of white ash bark; put all into a bottle and
shake it well; drink half a wine glass full in half a tumbler
full of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>


<h3>PRICKLY ASH TEA.</h3>

<p>Make this tea by steeping prickly ash bark in hot water;
take it three times a day before eating.</p>


<h3>GOOSEBERRY.</h3>

<p>The leaves and berry are good in all cases of inflammation,
being of a cooling nature; they were much used in the olden
time, for coughs, and in salves.</p>


<h3>TAMARACK.</h3>

<p>I use the bark in all my syrups, as it is cleansing and
quickens the circulative action.</p>


<h3>HEMLOCK.</h3>

<p>This bark is excellent in all colds, to be used as a steam
bath. It will break up a fever, and by taking a teaspoonful
of powdered mandrake root, internally, it will remove the
fever, and probably save fifty dollars doctor’s bill. It is good,
internally and externally. The tincture is very warming, and
good to bathe the back and loins, when weak or painful.
Always take few drops on sugar, internally, before bathing.
Remember, never bathe with any tincture without taking
something internally, it may injure you for life.</p>


<h3>CHICKWEED.</h3>

<p>This will be found good in all poultices for sores.</p>


<h3>SPIKENARD.</h3>

<p>Every one is well acquainted with this root; it is balsamic
and healing; I generally use it for coughs and general
debility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>


<h3>MALE FERN.</h3>

<p>This root is a great vermifuge; I have used it with success
for exterminating the tape worm; and is in no wise dangerous,
which cannot be said of some vermifuges. Always
administer a brisk cathartic after drinking a decoction of this
root, once a day for three days; then give the vermifuge for
three days, then a cathartic, and so on for nine days, and all
worms will be expelled, both from the stomach and bowels.
To be taken before eating.</p>


<h3>SWEET FERN.</h3>

<p>How little is known of this shrub, yet all know it by its
beautiful smell. For any derangement of the womb, there is
nothing better: Take five roots of this shrub and boil in two
quarts of water, down to one, and when cool strain; then
add one gill of Holland gin. Take half a wine glass full in
the morning, and a wine glass full at bed time. This is a good
remedy in all weaknesses, especially for children having weak
bones, or are troubled with scrofula, or any tumors; also, for
those who cannot hold their water, or have weak bowels.</p>


<h3>BITTER SWEET.</h3>

<p>This plant rises eight or ten feet in hight, and entwines
around trees the same as a vine; flowers in loose clusters,
always turning against the sun; the carolla is composed of
one petal, wheel shaped, and divided at the bottom or border
into five pointed segments, which are bent back; purple prominences,
like dots, surround the rim of the carolla, from the
nectary; the yellow anther making a beautiful contrast; the
flowers become bright red; berries something similar to currants,
and are of a bitter, sweet taste. This climbing shrub
grows common in low grounds and marshes. The dulcamara<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
is a powerful and useful medicine; it increases all the secretions
and excretions, excites the heart and arteries, and is also
beneficial in all cutaneous effections, rheumatism, scirrhus
swellings, ill-conditioned ulcers, scrofula, whites, jaundice, and
obstructed menses. Cancers of the breast have been cured
by the application of the juice to the cancer, and the green
leaves applied to the breast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;Boil half a pound of the bark of the bitter
sweet in eight quarts of spring water to the consumption of
one gallon; a gill to be taken three times a day; it is also
good in fevers. The patient ought to take a dose of sal
glauber once a week, while using the medicine.</p>


<h3>COMFREY.</h3>

<p>This well known, useful plant, rises about two feet in hight;
leaves very large, similar to water dock; roots long, thick as
a man’s thumb, very mucilaginous, and are black externally
and white within; flowers of a pale blue color. It grows in
moist meadows, near springs, and is planted in gardens for
family use. The roots are inspissant and demulcent, having
the same virtues as marsh mallow; they correct salt sharp
serum, heal erasions of the intestines in diarrhœa and dysentery,
and prevent the spitting of blood; bruised and applied
to ruptures, externally, they have proved beneficial.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;Take four ounces of the fresh roots, or
three of dry, four ounces of burdock root, two of red rose
willow bark, one of parsley, and two of yarrow tops; boil
these ingredients in four quarts of water and one of new milk,
to the consumption of two quarts; strain and sweeten it with
loaf sugar. A gill of this decoction, taken three times a day,
will cure the recent clap in a few days, using the tormentil
injection, elsewhere directed. It is also beneficial in curing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
fluor albus, or whites, in weakly females. The roots, boiled
in milk, are good for fluxes, dysentery, and ardor of urine.
Take two ounces of dry comfrey root, bruised, and one ounce
of tormentil root, boil them in three quarts of water down to
two; strain it and add a pint of brandy, with four ounces
of powdered loaf sugar dissolved in it. A gill may be taken
by adults, and a tablespoonful by children, four times a day,
in cases of dysentery, diarrhœa, or flux.</p>


<h3>FOX GLOVE.</h3>

<p>The stalk is erect, tapering, and is four feet in hight; leaves
large, oval, shady, wrinkled and veined, growing on short
winged foot-stalks, downy underneath; the lacteas attendant
on the flower stalks are small, spear shaped and sessile;
the flowers, always on one side, are purple, bell shaped, marked
internally with little dark colored spots, placed in whitish
rings, and long hairs defend the entrance of the tube, hence
no insects ever approach this flower. The flower stalks vary
in length; at first they depend like the flowers, afterwards
becoming erect, when they elevate a two-celled capsule, containing
many blackish seeds.</p>

<p>This most elegant plant is raised in gardens, and is an exotic
plant; flowers in July, and seeds in September. It would
take a small volume to describe all the virtues which different
authors have ascribed to its various qualities; however, as it
is a dangerous medicine in the hands of the unskilful, I will
give a few descriptions of its qualities, with directions how it
may be used with safety in families.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;Take of the dried bruised leaves of fox
glove four ounces, powder of masterwort root one ounce,
leaves of rue and wormwood, each, two ounces, elecampane
and comfrey root bruised, each, two ounces, lungwort and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
wild cherry tree bark, each, one ounce; put all the ingredients
into a new gallon earthen pot, and pour one gallon of
boiling rain water on them; cover the pot and set it near the
fire, on hot ashes, for twelve hours; after which strain the
liquor through a linen cloth and add four quarts of honey,
and let it stand near the fire twelve hours longer; then strain
the liquor and put it in bottles for use. In all consumptive
and asthmatic complaints, the patient may take a tablespoonful
of this balsam three or four times a day, in a tea
cupful of the following tea: put one ounce of skunk cabbage
root and half an ounce of wild cherry tree bark in a tea pot,
and pour boiling water on it, and use it daily; the dose may
be increased from a tablespoonful to a wine glass full three
times a day.</p>


<h3>SENNA.</h3>

<p>This plant rises from two to four feet in hight, resembling
a shrub, and sending out hollow, woody stems; leaves in
alternate order, compound, composed of several pairs, oval,
pointed and nerved pinnæ, of a yellowish green color; flowers
yellow, forming a spike consisting of five petals; the pod is
curved and short. It grows in Canada, along the Ottawa
river, in great quantities. It has been customary to reject
the pedicles of the leaves of senna, but this is mere prejudice,
for both leaves and pedicles act in the same way. The American
senna operates milder than the senna that is imported,
but it must be given in a larger dose.</p>

<p>Pour a pint of boiling water on eight drachms of American
senna, and put a teaspoonful of ginger, or the powder of
masterwort root, to it; let it stand in the pot for fifteen minutes
for use; sweetened, with milk in it, it will prove a mild
purge without griping. Children may take one or two teacupsful
twice a day. Adults may take a desert-spoonful of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
powder, with a teaspoonful of ginger, night and morning.
As a safe and gentle purge, the following electuary is an excellent
laxative for loosening the bowels of persons of costive
habits: Take of senna leaves, powdered, six ounces, masterwort
or ginger, one ounce, pulp of French prunes one pound,
pulp of tamarinds two ounces, molasses one pint and a half,
essential oil of caraway two drachms; boil the pulps in the
molasses to the consistence of honey, then add the powders,
and when the mixture cools put in the oil, and mix the whole
intimately. Dose, a teaspoonful twice a day.</p>


<h3>AVENS.</h3>

<p>This plant rises a foot in hight; root fibrous, very pleasant
and aromatic; leaves large and lyre shape; stalks upright
and hirsute; flowers yellow and terminal. It is a perennial
plant, and grows wild in the uncultivated fields of New Jersey
and the New England states. Flowers from June to July;
the roots are fibrous, of a dark red color externally, and
white internally; has the flavor of cloves, with a bitterish,
astringent taste. The large roots are preferable to the fibrous
ones, which must be dug up in April, cut into thin slices and
dried in the air as quick as possible. After being pulverized,
sift the powder through a hair sieve and put it in bottles,
well corked, for use. It is a good febrifuge, and is really an
excellent substitute for the Jesuit bark in the cure of intermittent
fevers, dysentery, chronic diarrhœa, wind colic, effections
of the stomach, asthmatic symptoms, and cases of debility.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;After the patient has taken a puke of the
American ipecacuanha, and the fever is off, a teaspoonful of
the powder may be administered every hour until the fever is
broke, then use my stomach bitters, mentioned in this work,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
in order to prevent a relapse. Take of aven root two ounces,
arum root half an ounce, (in powder,) skunk cabbage balls,
in powder, half an ounce, gentian and masterwort, each half
an ounce, sugar candy one ounce; mix one tablespoonful of
these powders and boil them in one quart of rain water and
one pint of new milk, for an hour. In all debilitating complaints,
or beginning consumptions, the patient may take two
teacupsful of this chocolate morning and evening, sweetened
with loaf sugar, and ride out every day two hours before dinner.</p>


<h3>GARDEN PÆONIE.</h3>

<p>This plant rises two feet in hight; leaves cut into lobes
which are oblong, or if pinnated, terminate by an odd pinnæ;
capsules, two; oblong hirsute, and crowned with a stigma. It
grows plentifully in the gardens throughout the United States.
The seed is imported from Switzerland; it is noted for its
virtues in the cure of epilepsy, and fits in children. The root
must be dug in March, dried and pulverized, and kept in
bottles, close corked, for use. Adults, subject to epilepsy,
may take a desert-spoonful of the powder four times a day,
in a teacupful of bitter sweet tea, made as follows: Pour a
quart of boiling water on an ounce of the bruised dry bark
of bitter sweet, taken from off the roots, and sweeten the tea
with sugar; give to children, two years old, ten grains of
the powder four times a day, in molasses, and wash it down
with the bitter sweet tea. Apply the bruised roots to the
soles of the feet when going to bed.</p>

be continued, is best. Life root, if given too freely, will debilitate
so rapidly as to lay dormant all the functions of life;
use it with caution where the patient is feeble. Nourish your
patients with whatever they require or fancy; oat meal is
healing and salutary.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Medical Coffee</span>&mdash;Is good in cancerous or scrofulous

head very low, and pour a spoonful of this juice in the nostril
every morning. Bayberry bark snuff, taken at night, operates

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;In all cases of putrefaction, or danger of the

the honey and grease two days, take a teaspoonful of the

anti-bilious physic; continue the other medicines, and take a

bay berry root, or catarrh snuff.</p>

<p>Digestive medicine is prepared thus: Take as much tartar
emetic as will lay on the handle of a teaspoon, twice that of

<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Anti-Bilious Physic.</span>&mdash;A sovereign remedy for all bilious,
autumnal, putrid, spotted, and yellow fevers, agues, and diseases
in children, sore throat, and consumptive cases. It acts
in bilious cases as a vomit, then as a cathartic; promotes
prespiration and rest. One dose is sufficient in any case. For
gravel and dysentery it is invaluable.</p>

<p><i>Preparation.</i>&mdash;Take eight ounces of powdered jalap, two
ounces coriander seed, two ounces of blood root, one ounce
of cassia, three ounces mandrake root, three ounces culver
root, and one grated nutmeg; infuse the whole in one gallon
of old brandy for twelve days, shaking it every day, and filter
for use.</p>

<p><i>Directions.</i>&mdash;Dose&mdash;for an adult, one ounce, or a common
wine glass full, upon an empty stomach; if it does not operate
as a vomit in ten minutes, take half a glass full more of
the physic; if a vomit is necessary, drink plenty of warm tea
and thin water gruel every hour, to aid the operation. For
an infant two months old, two teaspoonsful; give it the breast,
or warm tea. In any inflammable complaint, a glass of lemon
or lime punch, will check the operation, if too long continued.
Guard against taking cold. If pains in the head accompany
the disease, bathe the feet in warm water, and wash the
body in warm vinegar and water, in all cases of putrid and
yellow fevers.</p>

<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">To Preserve Fruit.</span>&mdash;All kinds of fruit which you wish
to keep fresh&mdash;such as grapes, peaches, pears, quinces, &amp;c.,
should be gathered carefully, and the stems broke off at full
length; then have a vessel of sealing wax, and dip the end
of the stem which you broke off from the tree or vine into it,
and lay them carefully in a cool, dry place, and they will
keep for months, and not wither.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">To make Essences.</span>&mdash;All kinds of essences in general use,
can be made by putting one ounce of the essential oil in one
pint of alcohol; half an ounce of the oil of cinnamon, cloves
and tanzy, is sufficient, to three half pints of alcohol; you
can reduce the others after the oil is cut or dissolved, by putting
in whiskey, which is preferable to alcohol.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Polypus, or Fungus of the Gum.</span>&mdash;This disease is essentially
hypertrophy of the gum, arising from mechanical irritation.
If a tooth decay on one side, below the level of the
gum, leaving a sharp margin in contact with the gum, a tumor
frequently forms from it, spreads into, and partially fills up
the hole of the tooth, or the vacancy between the two decaying
teeth; the tumor is usually composed of dense fibrous
tissue, covered with epithelium, and is almost insensible unless
ulcerated, when it becomes very painful. If the tumor be
removed, it will grow again and again, unless the tooth be
extracted, when it will suddenly disappear. The tumors
show, on dissection, an undulating surface of fibro-cellular
tissue, covered by a thick layer of epithelium.</p>

<p>The best application for this troublesome state of the gum
is sulphate of copper, applied every day or two.</p>

<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Cleansing and Strengthening
Syrup.</span>&mdash;Take equal parts of spikenard, spruce, sage,
sarsaparilla, tamarac, garden rhubarb, elder roots, the bark of burdock
roots, aven roots, wintergreen (such as bears the small red berry

<p>Another: Take half an ounce of Indian hemp, and add
one quart of boiling water; simmer down to one pint, and

one tablespoonful of brown sugar. Give the patient one tablespoonful
every three hours, and increase if the patient can

<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Composition.</span>&mdash;Take two pounds bayberry bark, one pound
ginger, one pound pulverized hemlock bark, one ounce cayenne

parts of the body, rheumatism, cold hands and feet, diarrhœa,
dysentery, colic, croup, giddiness, hysteria, mumps, jaundice,
worms, nervous disorders, and the various affections of the
skin.</p>

<p><i>Directions.</i>&mdash;For a grown persen half a teaspoonful of the
powder and add a little loaf sugar, rub them together and
add half a pint of boiling water; drink the tea as hot as you
can bear it. There is no occasion for swallowing the grounds,
as is a common practice, for the strength of the medicine will
be extracted by the boiling water, and the sediment can have
no other effect than to clog and irritate the stomach. When
the tea is taken the patient should be in bed with a warm
brick at their feet, or sitting by a fire wrapped in a blanket,
to create perspiration.</p>

day, and taking care not to catch cold.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Consumptive Complaints and Inflammation caused by
Colds in Wounds.</span>&mdash;Take yellow pond lily root and boil
till the strength is out, then strain and thicken with coarse

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Stomach Tincture.</span>&mdash;Take one ounce of gentian root,

apply to the nose in case of faintness.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Toothache Drops.</span>&mdash;Take wild celendine root in powder,
or wet a piece of lint with the juice, and apply it to the tooth.</p>

strain off the ley, and boil down very strong; give the patient
a teaspoonful once an hour for three or four hours. This is

berries of which drink a wine glass full. This will do when
the patient is first attacked.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Bathing for all Pains.</span>&mdash;Take three ounces of the oil

<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">A Cancer Under the Eye</span>&mdash;Was cured by drinking one
quart of tar water daily, and applying a plaster of tar and
mutton tallow melted together; this cured a cancer in two
months, and of twenty years standing. Or mix black pepper,
burned alum and honey, equal parts, and use it as an ointment.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">A Newly Discovered Cure for a Polypus.</span>&mdash;An elderly
lady applied to me for advice, who had been afflicted for a
long time with a fleshy excresence, which filled up the passage
of her nose. By using the following simple prescription a
cure was performed in a few days: Take half an ounce of
blood root, finely pulverized and sifted, and one drachm of
camomile; mix them together for a sternutatory. A small
pinch of this powder is to be snuffed up the nostrils for the
polypus of the nose, three times a day. The following wash,
or lotion, is to be thrown up the nostrils with a syringe twice
a day, until the polypus is removed: Dissolve half an ounce
of powdered alum in a gill of brandy, and shake the vial
until the alum is dissolved. This is a tried, safe and sure
cure for polypus of the nose without the use of instruments,
which subjects the patient to extreme pain and is often very
dangerous.</p>

<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Elixir Pro.</span>&mdash;Take one quart of good spirits, to which add
two ounces myrrh; let it stand in the sun four days, then add

<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Alterative Syrup.</span>&mdash;Take two pounds sarsaparilla, one

Drink a wine glass full three times a day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">For a Cough.</span>&mdash;Take two heads of garlic, a lemon sliced,
four ounces licorice, half a pint of liquor, four ounces flax
seed, three pints of water, boil down to one quart, and strain;
take a tea cup full on going to bed.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Recipe for a Cold.</span>&mdash;Take a large teaspoonful of linseed
with two penny worth of stick licorice, and a quarter of a
pound of sun raisins. Put them in two quarts of soft water;
add to it a quarter of a pound of brown sugar candy, powdered
and a tablespoonful of white wine vinegar, or lemon juice.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The vinegar is to be added only to the quantity
you are going immediately to take; for if it be put into the
whole, it is liable, in a little time, to grow flat. Drink half a
pint on going to bed, and take a little when the cough is troublesome.</p>

<p>This recipe generally cures the worst of colds, in one or
two days; and, if taken in time, may be said to be almost an
infallible remedy. It is a sovereign balsamic cordial for the
lungs, without the opening qualities which endanger fresh
colds in going out. It has been known to cure colds which
have almost been settled into consumptions, in less than three
weeks.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Bite of a Rattlesnake, or any other Poisonous Snake.</span>&mdash;It
is good, when you expect to be in danger of being bitten
by poisonous snakes, to keep a small bag of fine salt in your
pocket, so that you may bind it on. As soon as you are bit,
cut and scarify in and near the place where the bite is, with
a lancet, or sharp pointed knife; this will keep the orifice
open, so that the poison may the better be drawn out; then
take, if it can be had, one or two of the nubs or balls of the
thimble-weed, steep in water, pound it well, put it on the bite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
and keep it on a quarter or half hour; then see if it has made
a blister, and if not, repeat the application until you get one;
then take it off, but, in the mean time, take care to have the
person chewing the leaves or bark of white ash, and swallow
plenty of the juice, but not one drop of water, until the
poison is working out; take the leaves of white ash, mountain
flax, robin’s plantain roots, tops, and bloodwort, (called by
some St. Andrew’s crosswort, and by some quinsy) roots and
tops, and snake violet (sometimes called buck-horn plantain)
roots and tops, and conicle roots, altogether, or such parts as
can be collected in great haste, about a handful of each, and
pound all together; then put them into a pot of water, and
boil them until very strong, (save some out to drink often and
plentifully,) and wash and bathe the part affected with this
preparation often, rubbing, stroking and working above, below,
and all around, pressing toward the wound; the liquor
should be about blood warm; apply on the bite a cabbage
leaf, or a smooth plantain leaf, wilted by the fire; apply your
herbs and liquor like a poultice, all over the limb or the part
affected, and repeat as often as the poultice gets too dry&mdash;not
forgetting to drink often of the liquor. If the poison
doth rage much, give the juice of horehound and
brown sugar, to drink. But I tell you again, give no water
to drink, and take care to keep the wound open and moving,
with the leaves wilted by the fire.</p>

<p>When you want to heal the wound, make an ointment of
hog’s lard and ox-weed, green bark of sweet elder, the smooth
leaf plantain roots and tops, and anoint the part two or three
times a day, or as you find need. After the cure is effected,
you ought to physic well, in order to cleanse the blood; and
to prevent a return of the sickness and preserve the eye-sight;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
the patient may have new milk to drink, with other drinks.
And when the poison is out of the system, be careful not to
drink great draughts of water, but make tea of good things,
to warm and sweeten the blood. In this way, I have kept
patients from one drop of water, for full nine days. One John
Lee, being hit on his feet, had three doctors to attend him,
who soon fixed him for his winding-sheet. He had been laid
out near two hours, when a man came in and gave him the
snake violet and bloodwort juice, in white or sweet wine, half
of each, mixed together, and the man recovered and lived.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Stomach Faintness, Sickness and Swelling.</span>&mdash;Take the

one spoonful of white vitriol and half a spoonful of raw alum,
pounded fine, one spoonful of the spirits of wine, half a large
thimble full of gum elerne, made fine as can be; let it stand
till it is cold, and bottle it up for use.</p>

<p>The way to use it, is to make it as hot as you can bear it,
in an earthen vessel, and bathe the place often and well.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">To stop Bleeding, and to Heal a Flesh Wound.</span>&mdash;Take
a clean linen rag, dry it well by the fire so that it begins to
be brown; then put it to the blaze, and let it burn to a good
cinder, put it on the wound as hot as you can, bind it on the
wound and keep it on till it works loose, and it will stop the
blood; if it wants more healing, apply clean lint instead of a
plaster, and make a wash of liquor of soap and urine, spikenard,
or the like.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">For the Rheumatism.</span>&mdash;Take a small glass bottle full of
angle-worms, washed clean, with a rag or paper stopple, and
put the bottle into a loaf of bread, and mould it to bake as
usual; set it into the oven and bake it well, and after your
bread is drawn out of the oven, let it stand till it gets cold;
then cut it open, and the worms will make a fine oil; you
may strain the oil from the muddy bottom, and anoint the
place affected with it. For a drink, put the root and tops of
princes pine into brandy, and drink night and morning as you
can bear, repeating your anointing as often as required, and
keep warm.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Another&mdash;For Rheumatism, or Painful Swelling of

the oil and keep it for use; anoint the place affected hot by

sarsaparilla root, prickly ash bark, black birch bark, garden
nettle roots and burdock roots, and half a bushel of good malt

good beer, let it work well, and drink as you find you can
bear; keep yourself from wet and cold.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">An Excellent Salve for Burns and other Sores.</span>&mdash;Take
one gallon of good old cider, and steep one pound of

half a pound of deer or mutton tallow; stew it over a moderate

then strain it again very clean, and stew it away very moderately,
until it is hard enough to form into pills, as you may
ascertain by cooling some of it as the rest is boiling;
when you find it is sufficiently hard, take it off the fire and
put it into a small dish; burn two or three egg shells on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
hot coals till they will pound fine enough to go through a
coarse sieve, and near three spoonsful of fine flour of brimstone,
together, and put it into the physic; mix it all the time
while cooling, to prevent the powders from settling. A grown
person may take as much as a tablespoonful at night, before
going to bed, either made into pills or dissolved in water, or
in the morning, fasting; if it does not work down in two
hours, take half as much more, and keep repeating until it
does work; drink a great plenty of water gruel, made of Indian
meal.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">An Ointment for the King’s Evil.</span>&mdash;Take one pound of
butter made in May, and take as much of the roots of fresh
fox glove (what some call lady-shoe), pound it very fine, and
put as much in the butter as will mix; set it in the hot sun
thirty days, taking it in evenings, and days when it rains or is
very cloudy; after it has had thirty days’ sun, press out the
ointment, and annoint the king’s evil. For this purpose, it is
said it has no equal; you must physic the blood well to carry
it off.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">For a Cough of long continuance.</span>&mdash;Take three or four
quarts of wheat bran, boil it in a pailful of water to a strong
wort; then take it off the fire, take out near a quart of the
wort and set it away to drink; then put your feet into the
bran and liquor, and rub, scrape and work the soles of your
feet with an old knife as long as the water is warm; then go
right into a warm bed and drink the rest of the wort you have
saved out; sweat plentifully and so repeat it three or four
nights, and you will likely find help in almost any cough; be
careful not to get any cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Syrup for a Cough.</span>&mdash;Take one or two turnips, slice them
very thin, take a pewter or earthen basin and sprinkle it over
with brown sugar, then lay on a layer of elecampane roots,
sliced or pounded, then a laying of sugar, next of turnips, and
so on until the basin is nearly full; set it in an oven, or
a warm cellar, a day or a night, and you will have a fine
syrup. Take half a gill on going to bed; you may eat the
roots also&mdash;but, as they open the pores of the body, you
ought to be careful not to get cold.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Another.</span>&mdash;Take hoarhound, garden colt’s-foot roots, spikenard
roots, and, for weakness, add hartshorn, Solomon’s seal,
comfrey and brook liverwort; stew in water till it is strong,
then strain off the liquor, and to a quart of the syrup add
half a pound of honey or good brown sugar, and a gill of
rum; simmer again over the fire half an hour and bottle it
up; take as you can bear, night and morning, fasting.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Wind Cholic&mdash;Indian Medicine.</span>&mdash;Take the bark or buds
of boxwood, such as has a large blossom in the spring, much
like a peach blossom&mdash;the tree is short and scrubby, and
bears paleish berries; boil the bark or buds, or both together,
in water, and give the person plenty to drink, to break away
the wind, and it will quickly give the patient ease.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Hard Swelling&mdash;for Man or Beast.</span>&mdash;Make an ointment
of one pound of the bark of bittersweet, half pound of young
and tender mullen leaves, a large handful of the white of hen
dung and a handful of wormwood; boil all together in water
till the strength is all boiled out; squeeze out the liquor and
strain it clean; now add one pound of hog’s lard, stew it
till the water is all out, then turn it into a small vessel and keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
it for use, to annoint the place swelled; if you find it is not
powerful enough, add to a gill of the ointment, one spoonful
of the spirits of vitriol, or half a spoonful of the oil of vitriol,
well mixed by a hot fire or with a hot iron. If it is a beast
you have in hand, the spirits and oil of vitriol may be used
with neat’s foot oil for the same purpose, or be put into other
ointments for swellings, with safety; it is good for old crusty,
hard, scabby sores, to work out hard, dead matter or crusts
in sores, for both man or beast, and set the sore to work.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Dropsy.</span>&mdash;For persons inclined to dropsy, or stoppage of
urine, and swelling in the body, take the roots of one-berry,
so called because it bears but one berry in a place, which is
large, red, resembling a strawberry; by some it is called
Scotch bonnet, because the bud on the top, before the blossom
comes, resembles that bonnet; it grows some like a
weed, about logs, stone-heaps or old fences; it has a large leaf,
which falls off in the fall of the year, and grows again the
next spring; some call this dropsy root. Take this root and
boil it in water, and drink plenty of it. It is also very good
for horses and cattle, if they swell in their bodies, for stoppage
of water and great pain, add some rosin to it.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Ulcers, Sores and Hard Swellings on the Joints.</span>&mdash;If
they have been so for many years, take half a pailful of the
bark of the red roots of red willow, (found on low, wet
land,) scrape it off very fine with a knife; the bark must be
red, as you will find some will be red and some not, as both
will grow from one tree or bunch of willow bushes; that
which is not red will not do at all, and if such large red willow
is not to be had, get a small willow which is called rose
willow, and grows on dry, hilly land, and sometimes on flat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
plains, two, three and four feet high, and has a bunch of leaves
on the top, much in the form of a rose, from which it takes
its name, and it will answer for the same purpose; take the
red bark of these roots, as of the other, and boil it very strong
in a large pot of water; then take it off the fire, and place the
joint over the steam, covered over with a blanket and fermented
as long as the liquor is hot; then wash and bathe as
long as the liquor is warm, and bind on as much of the bark
as you can keep on, and so repeat twice a day; it may be
some months before a cure is completed.</p>

<p>In cases where fever sores existed, or the like, and the bone
has rotted by the fever, and the scales come out, this treatment
has made the greatest number of cures, in such cases, of any
I have ever met with, or knew; it is also very good to put
about half a brick, well pounded, in the liquor; in using this
great remedy, you ought first to physic the blood thoroughly,
to throw off the old humors, and make the cure sound and
firm; afterwards, use plenty of scabis root, made into a tea,
and drink every day, or make a good beer with it; or sometimes
take it in powders&mdash;about a spoonful.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Worms in Children.</span>&mdash;Take the third bark (which is the
inner one,) of spotted alder, that bears a small, red berry,
scrape off the bark with a knife, and boil half a pound in
about one gallon of water, to one quart; then strain it clean,
and take out, for a child, about half a pint, and set it away
in a bottle; add to the other about half a pint of sweet milk
and about half a pint of molasses; simmer these together
over the fire a little while, and bottle it up; one day before
the full or change of the moon, give the child a third part of
that you saved out, and the rest the two next mornings; after
that let them drink the syrup.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Cancers.</span>&mdash;Take the leaves and small, tender tops or
branches of poke-weed; pound together and squeeze out the
juice, and put it into an earthen pot; set it in the sun, till it
has acquired the thickness of an ointment; spread the plaster
the size of the sore on the leaf of the plant, when green, and
on black silk in the winter; apply a new plaster three or
four times during the day, if the pain can be indured,
which is sometimes very great. This remedy, which kills
and loosens the cancer at the bottom and draws it to the
outside, makes it apparently worse for the time, on first using,
but nevertheless effects a radical cure in about five or six
months. No physic or strong drink is to be made use of, except
in case of fainting, when a little good spirits may be
used. This has effected cures, in many instances, where the
cancers were of an inveterate kind and of long duration, and
has never failed of success.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Salt Rheum or Scurvy.</span>&mdash;Take the poke-weed leaves, any
time in the summer, pound and squeeze out the juice; strain
it into a pewter basin, and set in the sun until it becomes a
salve; then put it into an earthen mug and add fresh butter
and beeswax, sufficient to make an ointment of common thickness;
simmer the whole over the fire, and keep constantly
stirring it until it is thoroughly mixed; when cold, rub the
part affected twice a day, till the cure is completed, which
will be in the course of three or four months; the patient
will soon experience its good effects.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Whooping Cough.</span>&mdash;Take a good handful of dry colts-foot
leaves, cut them small and boil them in one quart of spring
water to half a pint, then take it off the fire, and when it is
almost cold, strain it clean through a cloth, squeezing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
herbs as dry as you can; then dissolve in it one ounce of
brown sugar candy, finely powdered, and give a child three
or four years old one spoonful, cold or warm, according to the
season, and so in proportion to the age and strength, three or
four times a day (or oftener if the fits of coughing come frequently,)
till well, which will be in two or three days; it will
soon abate the fits of coughing.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Rheumatism.</span>&mdash;A specific and infallible cure for the most
inveterate Rheumatism of many years standing, has been
communicated by a man of character from the coast of Guinea.
He says the negroes of that country easily remove it in a little
time, by rubbing the part affected with a mixture of cayenne
pepper and strong spirits; the rubbing must be continued
for some time, and repeated till the cure is effected; the pepper
must be reduced to powder. Several Americans, most
grievously tormented with this intolerable disorder, have been
so effectually relieved by this happy communication, as not
to have the least remains of it, and with my own experience,
I believe it, but would rather depend on it with the addition
of drinking a glass of princes pine, steeped in good French
brandy, morning and evening, for the blood; I do not doubt
of its being an almost certain cure&mdash;but remember to guard
against cold and wet.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Sore Breast.</span>&mdash;Take the sprouts of the first year’s growth
of bitter poplar, and scrape off the bark, and the bark of
sumack roots, a handful of each, half a handful of camomile
and as much of mullen leaves; stew in one pound of hog’s
fat over a moderate fire, then strain it clean and add half a
gill of good rum; simmer again to the consumption of the
rum, and it is fit for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">For a Poultice</span>&mdash;Take roots and some of the tender leaves
of scabious, pound in a mortar to a salve and spread it on a
piece of thin leather; heat it hot by the fire until it is brown,
cover it over with the before mentioned ointment, and apply to
the breast; repeat as often as you find need.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Ulcer.</span>&mdash;A tea of white pine bark, elixir salutes and the
yolk of an egg, is good for an inward ulcer that is broke.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Burns.</span>&mdash;Make a poultice of Indian meal and emptyings,
to draw out the fire; when it is out, strew on red precipitate,
then apply a plaster made of hog’s fat, mutton tallow and
beeswax; simmer together, take it off and cool it so as not
to curdle the egg, then put in the yolk of an egg, and stir it
till it becomes the consistency of salve.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Dissolving Stone in the Bladder.</span>&mdash;Take the expressed
juice of horse mint and red onion, one gill of each, every
morning and evening, till the complaint be removed; if the
green mint cannot be had, make a strong decoction of the

<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Weak Joints.</span>&mdash;When the cord is stretched, take yarrow,
Solomon’s seal, comfrey roots and mug-wort, make it into an
ointment, with fresh butter or cat’s grease; to guard the
stomach, make a tea of St. John’s wort.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Flux.</span>&mdash;Take two teaspoonfuls of clean hickory or oak
ashes, quite hot, in half a gill of old spirits or milk, night
and morning, two or three days if necessary; let the patient
live on a flour diet altogether, and it is good to wear warm
flannel next the stomach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Rheumatism.</span>&mdash;Take one pound of roll brimstone, pound it
fine and put it into an earthen pot; pour thereon one gallon
of boiling water, and stir it well; after standing about twenty-four
hours, it is fit for use. Drink half a pint in the morning,
before breakfast, and the same before going to bed, and
a radical cure will be effected in the space of a few weeks.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Broken Bones.</span>&mdash;Take the bark of tag alder, wormwood
tops and the white of hen-dung; boil in water till the strength

<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Scald or Burn.</span>&mdash;Take half a pint of milk, thicken it

grass, comfrey roots, Indian beans, parsley, violets, daisy,
Johnwort, low balm, tormentile, low bittory, elder flowers and garden
berage, a good handful of each; boil them two or three
hours, strain and let it settle, pour it off from the dregs and
put into it a little licorice and annis-seed; boil it again, strain
and put into it a pint of molasses, make it just boil, and it is
done. Dose for a child three months old, a spoonful in the
morning, before noon, afternoon and at night.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">To make Elixir Pro.</span>&mdash;Take one quart of good spirits,
add to it two ounces of myrrh; let it stand in the warm sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
four days, then add half ounce socotrin aloes and one ounce

make them all into a powder, with juice of coolwort

of humors; they open obstructions of the liver and spleen,
and remove diseases therefrom. Take half a drachm on going
to bed.</p>

<p>These drops are useful in scalding of urine, from syphilitic
or other inflammations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Bloody Flux.</span>&mdash;Take fresh butter, melt and skim curdy
part; give two teaspoonsful two or three times a day.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Another.</span>&mdash;Take three-fourths ounce old cheese, scrape it
fine in a pint new milk, thickened with flour; let this be the
diet; purge with rhubarb.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Plaster</span>&mdash;To draw all humors to one place. Take two
quarts strong beer, not sour, four ounces copperas, four ounces
bole Armenia, six drachms Venice turpentine, and one pint
tar; pulverize hard substances, and mix all in an iron vessel;
simmer (not boil,) over a slow coal fire, stirring often, until it
is reduced to one quart; take it from the fire, stirring it constantly
while cooling; it will take from twelve to sixteen
hours to prepare it.</p>

<p><i>Manner of Using.</i>&mdash;Spread it on a piece of soft leather,
two inches or more in diameter; put the plaster on when you
want to draw the sore; dress it once in two days, until it begins
to run, then dress every morning.</p>

<p><i>Manner of Dressing.</i>&mdash;Take the plaster off, and scrape off

one ounce mandrake root; when cold, add a quarter pound
salts; take half tea cup on going to bed. Drink sarsaparilla
and spotted maple tea; be careful not to overheat the blood.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Asparagus Roots.</span>&mdash;An excellent ingredient in all compositions
intended to cleanse the viscera, especially where
there are obstructions, and in jaundice and dropsy, as it operates
on the urine; it is likewise used in disorders of the breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Sudorific Drops.</span>&mdash;Two ounces ipecac, two ounces saffron,
two ounces camphor, two ounces Virginia snake root, two
ounces opium, three quarts Holland gin or spirits; let stand
two weeks and strain. Dose&mdash;one teaspoonful in a cup of
catnip or pennyroyal tea, given every hour. To raise perspiration
in colds, fevers and inflammations, I know of no medicine
so sure in its operation as this.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Madame Young’s Medica Mentum.</span>&mdash;Half ounce of gum
aloes, one ounce each of rhubarb and ginger, one teaspoonful
myrrh and cayenne pepper, and one quart spirits; steep twenty-four
hours, and add one teacup sugar and half pint water.
Take one to two tablespoonsful an hour before eating. This

<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Bowel Complaint.</span>&mdash;One ounce rhubarb, one teaspoonful
saleratus, and one pint boiling water; when cold, add two teaspoonsful
essence peppermint; a tablespoonful to be taken every

and tablespoonful saltpetre; apply with bandage.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Neutralizing Cordial</span>&mdash;Good for dysentery, cholera morbus
and diarrhœa. Take one pound green peppermint, simmer
in half gallon water and strain off; then take four ounces
Turkey rhubarb, simmer into half a gallon water, till all the
strength is out; then strain, add these two liquids together,
with two ounces saleratus and three pounds loaf sugar; then
boil all a few minutes, and when nearly cold, add half pint
brandy. Dose, wine glass full.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Elder Wine.</span>&mdash;Take sixteen quarts of elder berries, clean
from the stem, put with six gallons cold water in a large tub;
let them stand two days, then boil them till the berries fall to
the bottom; strain and squeeze, and to every gallon liquor
add three pounds brown sugar; boil and add quarter pound
bruised ginger, two ounces allspice, and cloves, if you like;
when cold, add a little yeast; let it work two days, then cork
bottle up tight.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Swellings.</span>&mdash;Dogmacamus is good, scraped, for swellings;
steep in milk and water.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Acid Cough Drops.</span>&mdash;One pound sumach berries, four
ounces elecampane, one ounce West Indian or African cayenne,
one gallon vinegar; boil, strain and add three pounds honey,
or double the quantity of molasses. If you add licorice, wild
turnip, skunk cabbage, say two ounces, you will have a syrup
that will cure sore throat, mouth or lungs. Take a tablespoonful
when the cough is troublesome, or every two hours,
gargling it in the throat, if sore.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Snuff.</span>&mdash;For headache and catarrh: Take one pound yellow
dock, half pound bayberry, four ounces elecampane, three
ounces bloodroot and three ounces beth-root. Take a pinch
occasionally, particularly on going to bed.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Vegetable Tooth Powder.</span>&mdash;Equal parts bayberry bark,
yellow oak bark, black alder bark, pulverized; add half a
pound elecampane, quarter pound prickly ash bark, four ounces
cloves. This will cure scurvy, and, if the teeth are sore
and loose, it will cure and make them firm in a short time.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Nerve Drops.</span>&mdash;One pint and half gin, half pint water,
two ounces nerve powder, one ounce hops, pulverized, half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
ounce skunk cabbage; let this stand ten days, shaking it often;
strain and let it settle. This will calm and strengthen the nervous
system; whereas opium destroys every energy of the
system, and makes it a complete wreck.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Anodyne Bathing Solution.</span>&mdash;Two ounces camphor, six
fluid drachms solution ammonia, and one pint essence lavender;
mix the lavender with the ammonia, then put in camphor,
and it is ready for use.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Ulcers or Bad Sores.</span>&mdash;Boil one pound each vervain, yellow
dock and sage, half pound cicuta leaves, in one gallon
water; wet cloths in this, and let them lay on the sores;
then dry and sprinkle with powdered bloodroot, mornings
only. Make a strong tea of vervain, drink a teacupful three
times a day, taking three or four of my bilious pills at night,
for nine nights successively.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Iroquois Universal Ointment.</span>&mdash;Take one pound tobacco
leaves, bruise and steep twelve hours in one pint red wine;
then add half pound fresh hog’s lard, simmer over a slow fire
till the red wine is consumed; then add four ounces tobacco
juice and two ounces rosin; simmer again till juice is evaporated,
then add one ounce wild turnip, and rosin sufficient to
make into an ointment. This is good for sores of every description,
and a wound dressed with this will never putrefy; if
you have pain in your head, anoint your temples; apply to
the stomach and lungs, and no inflammation will settle there;
anoint the bowels of children in case of worms or weakness.
This ointment is, as I know, the best now in use, for sores,
burns, ulcers, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Old Sores.</span>&mdash;Pumpkin or carrot poultice is good for old
sores; if they smell bad, sprinkle charcoal on the poultice;
to prevent putrefaction, wash it twice a day in saltpeter water.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">St. Anthony’s Fire.</span>&mdash;Drink lemonade and tar water, warm,
and wash in tar water.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Anti-Emetic Drops.</span>&mdash;Take a teacup full of good cider vinegar;
add a teaspoonful each of salt and cayenne pepper; give a
teaspoonful every fifteen minutes. I never knew a case where
but a half teaspoonful had not the desired effect. It is good
in external application for rheumatism, bruises, headaches and
sprains; for the latter, use hot.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Sorrel Extract.</span>&mdash;If you wish to make sorrel extract, for
burns or sores, gather it before the 20th June, press out the
juice and dry on a pewter plate. This is the best way to
make good extract.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">To Cleanse the Blood and Strengthen the Liver.</span>&mdash;Wide
leaf dock, black alder bark and buds, burdock roots and
leaves, sarsaparilla, striped maple, and half as much bloodroot;.
a handful of each, to which add one gallon of water. Drink a
teacup full three times a day, before eating.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Fevers.</span>&mdash;Marigolds are good to put on the stomach, in all
cases of fevers, inflammation, &amp;c.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Goitre, or Adam’s Apple.</span>&mdash;Take a teaspoonful nettle seed,
pulverized, morning and noon; at night take a teaspoonful of
a mixture of one ounce cream tartar, one ounce sulphur, and
half ounce Turkey rhubarb. This is good for corpulent people
and for spitting blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Tonic.</span>&mdash;Red rose willow is an excellent tonic.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Chronic Rheumatism.</span>&mdash;Unicorn root (aletois farinasa), is
good with prickly ash bark; add a small quantity bloodroot;
it is necessary in some cases to add spirits, for flatulency, colic
or hysterics. Take a teaspoonful in warm water.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Tincture of Soap Anodyne.</span>&mdash;Take two ounces hard soap,
shaved, one ounce opium, one ounce camphor, half ounce of
rosemary, two pounds alcohol; let the soap and opium stand
three days; shake often, then add the camphor and oil. This
is good for sprains, and pains of all descriptions.</p>

<p>But one thing I would remark; that is, where opium is
used frequently, it will debilitate; but from three to five times
will not injure, but will allay pains for the time being.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Rheumatism.</span>&mdash;Take one ounce mandrake, two ounces Epsom
salts, put into one quart metheglin wine&mdash;wine glass twice
a day; an anodyne at night, say a cup of strong hop tea;
rub the parts affected with the following ointment: boil skunk
cabbage in water, make a strong decoction, then add hog’s
lard, simmer all the water away, and add sulphur. This is
an excellent anti-rheumatic ointment. It must be rubbed
near the fire.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">For Humors.</span>&mdash;Make a very strong decoction of boiled oats,
to one pint of which add one ounce saltpeter; this is good
for swellings. For carbuncles, mix equal parts of bloodroot,
beth root and honey; purge with anti-bilious pills.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Rheumatism.</span>&mdash;Take bark of sumach roots, and cayenne, if
it can be borne by the patient; boil in rum and bathe the
parts; take inwardly a strong decoction of prickly ash bark.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
I would recommend salt and vinegar, with cayenne, for bathing,
but in most cases it must be hot, and applied with cloths.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Indian Turnip, or Wake Robin.</span>&mdash;For chronic, deep-rooted
rheumatism, pains, debilitated habits, loss of appetite, lowness
of spirits, faintness, &amp;c. Take three pounds fine Indian
turnip and three pounds fine loaf sugar; mix them together
in a mortar; there must be equal parts of each, well mixed.
Take a teaspoonful three times a day, half hour before eating;
it must be taken dry, if possible. Begin with half teaspoonful
and increase to whole one.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Gravel.</span>&mdash;Life root is good for the gravel.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Dropsy.</span>&mdash;Wild lettuce is good for dropsy, ten or twelve
grains a day; use white cohosh as drink, also cuckles seed
mixed with juniper berries.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Gall</span>, &amp;c.&mdash;Low centuary, of all herbs, is one of the best
for overflowing of the gall, and, in my opinion, is good in
jaundice and all bilious complaints, and also in cleansing the
blood from humors; it must be used plentifully and for some
weeks.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Bloodroot.</span>&mdash;This is good for the rattles; mix with honey
and give a child five years old a teaspoonful.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Bone Ointment.</span>&mdash;Equal parts small kind mullen, red clover
tops, burdock burs, plantain, sweet alder bark, yarrow,
black alder buds and tobacco; simmer down in hog’s lard
and fresh butter. This ointment is likewise good for all kinds
of sores.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Sticking Salve.</span>&mdash;Equal parts catnip tops, horsemint, sarsaparilla,
striped (some call it soft) maple, spikenard, mouse
wood, (this wood or tree grows bushy, and the wood is tender
but the bark is tough; use the wood and bark,) comfrey, young
mullen leaves, Solomon’s seal, yellow dock, princes pine, wormwood;
boil down thick, then add one pound and four ounces
mutton tallow; roll, and it is fit for use; all cuts and sores,
with or without swellings, inflammations and wounds, this
will cure, and no proud flesh will be created.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Balsam of Honey.</span>&mdash;Take as much balsam of tolu as will
dissolve in alcohol.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Oil Soap.</span>&mdash;Take as much Castile soap as will dissolve in
alcohol.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Salve for Scrofulous Sores.</span>&mdash;Take turpentine, and half
a pound bayberry, and tallow; dissolve and add sweet oil if
necessary.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">The best Salve</span> I ever found, in all cases of humors, is
composed of raw linseed oil, beeswax, and mutton tallow, for
sore lips, and chapped hands; if the sore is very bad, sprinkle
pulverized bloodroot on it every morning, then apply salve;
a sore need not be washed but once a day, but dress it three
times a day, if bad.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Ointment Pills.</span>&mdash;Sweet fern, sweet apple-tree, rose leaves,
cats foot, and cream; simmer on a slow fire. The best I ever
found was composed of hog’s dung and lamp oil, simmered;
a little beeswax will be good to keep it firm.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Hot Drops.</span>&mdash;To one quart alcohol add one ounce hemlock
oil, one ounce gum myrrh, two tablespoonsful cayenne; shake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
well twice a day for at least a week. This is good for rheumatism,
pains in head and stomach. Take from ten drops to
a teaspoonful, in sugar and water.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Tar Syrup.</span>&mdash;One gill tar, one pint wheat bran, half pound
loaf sugar, and two quarts water. Dose, wine glass full three
times per day, for cough and consumptive complaints.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Rupture Plaster.</span>&mdash;One part fresh buckthorn, bruised,
and two parts fresh cranes bill; blend by bruising in a mortar;
spread on leather and apply; wear a truss or bandage;
this must be occasionally changed and worn three months.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Indian Turnip.</span>&mdash;Pulverize it fine, two ounces loaf sugar
or sugar candy, half ounce flour sulphur; mix and let the patient
take a teaspoonful three times a day, dry, if possible, if
not, in any vehicle the most palatable, molasses, &amp;c. Use in
all lingering, or beginning of pains of a consumptive nature,
such as pain in the breast, weak appetite, and slow circulation
of the blood; where there is any cough, whether loose or
tight, add half ounce pulverized bloodroot. I can testify by
experience that this is good, not only for the young, but particularly
for the aged, it is better than all the tinctures in the
world, as it creates action and warms the blood. Either of
the ingredients can be omitted, if disagreeable.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">For Consumptive Persons</span>.&mdash;Two ounces aven root, half
ounce wild turnip, one skunk cabbage ball, masterwort and
ginseng, half ounce each, and one ounce sugar candy; mix
one tablespoonful, and boil in one quart water; add one pint
new milk; two teacupsful of this chocolate to be taken night
and morning; bathe with cold or tepid water every morning,
if the patient can bear it; walking is the best exercise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Cancers.</span>&mdash;A cancer under the eye was cured by the patient
drinking one quart of tar water daily, and apply a plaster
and mutton tallow, melted together; this cured a cancer
of twenty years standing, in two months; mix black pepper,
burnt alum, and honey, equal parts, and use as an ointment;
the last I would not recommend to be used but a few times&mdash;rather
use bloodroot, daily.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Dysentery, or Relax in Children.</span>&mdash;Take equal parts
good vinegar and hens’ eggs, and beat them well together;
mix in wheat flour, stiff as common dough; bake this moderately,
then pulverize; give one teaspoonful of the powder
three times a day; mix with the above powder, hens’ gizzards,
pulverized.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Bathing with Ox Gall.</span>&mdash;In gout or pains, heat a shovel,
mix a little vinegar and pour on; bathe the parts affected
with the steam. In all pains, never use any local application,
without taking some warming medicine internally, if but a
little red pepper; it is not essential to give alcohol in any
form; a little carminative, such as pulverized mandrakes, or
angelica seed, ought always to be on hand.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Anti-Bilious Powders.</span>&mdash;One pound jalap, two pounds
Alexandria senna, one pound peppermint; let these all be
pulverized, then mix, after sifting fine; for a grown person, a
teaspoonful in a cup full of boiling water; then cool, sweeten
it and drink; no harm if two teaspoonsful are taken. I would
advise the patient to take three anti-bilious pills the night
previous. This medicine can be taken at all times.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">To Promote the Growth of the Hair.</span>&mdash;Mix equal parts
olive oil, spirits rosemary, and bloodroot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

coffee.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Anti-Scrofulous Plaster.</span>&mdash;One gill tar, two yolks eggs
roasted inside, and one puff ball; simmer over a slow fire,
spread on thin leather, and apply.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Ulcer on the Leg.</span>&mdash;Wash the ulcer twice a day, night
and morning, with one pint of weak lime water, and apply a
poultice over the sore, twice a day, made of blood root and
beth root, finely pulverized and mixed with honey; in case
the leg is swelled, apply a poultice of slippery elm bark, every
night.</p>

<p>Give a wine glass full of my cleansing syrup, morning, noon
and at bed time, and drink, as a common beverage, the following:
take a handful each of cherry bark and princes pine,
put them into two quarts boiling water, and let it steep well;
then strain. Abstain from spirituous liquors and salt meats.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Cancer.</span>&mdash;Take the powder of dry yellow dock root, wet
with port wine and put it on the cancer, renewing it three
times a day; make your daily drink a decoction of one handful
of yellow dock root, bruised, and a handful of the bark or
buds of black alder, boiled in four quarts of rain water to the
consumption of two quarts.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Prolapsus Uteri.</span>&mdash;Take one ounce each of white oak
bark, beth root, crowfoot roots, and rose leaves; boil the
whole in four quarts of water, down to two; strain the decoction,
to which add a pint of port wine, and two ounces of
powdered alum, while it is warm. The patient must first
take a dose of castor oil, and, after its operation, must foment
the part four or five times a day, with a flannel dipped in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
decoction as warm as it can be held in the hand. In order
to prevent a relapse, the patient must wet the parts twice a
day with warm water, in which a spoonful of salt has been
dissolved, and keep the bowels open by a dose of castor oil
once a week, using salt water bath twice a week.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Rupture of the Testicles.</span>&mdash;Three years ago, a Canadian,
who had been laboring under a large swelling of the testicles,
and been given up as incurable, made application to me. The
surgeons had held consultation over him, and agreed that he
must be castrated, but he would not comply. Upon examination,
I found it to be a sarcocele, or fleshy tumor of the
testicles, and therefore resolved to attempt the cure by discutients.
I first cleansed and purified the blood from humors
and mercury, and applied the following cataplasm, or poultice,
over the scrotum: take every-night two handsful of goose-grass,
or cleavers, in two quarts of cider vinegar; foment the
swelling with flannel wet in the vinegar, for the space of fifteen
minutes, then bind the leaves over the tumor. Anoint
it frequently, every day, with the following ointment: take
the scrapings of a powder horn, and the inner bark of rose
willow, pound it fine, and wet it well with brandy; apply
through the day.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Hives in Children.</span>&mdash;Dissolve twenty grains of bitter root
in six teaspoonsful of warm water, and give the child, according
to age&mdash;from six months to a year old, one to two teaspoonsful
of the infusion; if it does not operate in fifteen
minutes, give the child a little warm camomile tea, in order
to cleanse the stomach; after the operation, give it, according
to age, a little poppies of syrup, in catnip tea. Give the
child, until well, the following: take one ounce of drago<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>n’s
claw root, ten grains of bitter root, and a quarter of an ounce
of mandrake root; pour on all these one quart of boiling
water, and let them steep four hours; stir frequently, then
strain; give from a teaspoonful to a tablespoonful every four
hours, until well; give always according to age.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Syrup for Worms.</span>&mdash;Take six ounces of fresh bark of
black alder, eight ounces of dry buck-horn plantain, and three
ounces of unicorn root; boil the ingredients in four quarts of
water, down to two; strain the decoction, to which add two
quarts of molasses, and boil it away to the consistency of syrup.
Children from two to four years of age, may take from
three to four teaspoonsful of the syrup, morning and evening,
for three days before both the full and change of the moon,
which will carry away the worms, and stop the fever. Adults
may take a wine glass full, morning and evening, for three
days respectively, before both the full and change of the
moon.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">To Create an Appetite.</span>&mdash;Dissolve two tablespoonsful of
bay salt in half pint of warm rain water, and add one ounce
of rectified spirits of salts. Dose&mdash;a teaspoonful, in a wine
glass of cold water, before breakfast and dinner. This will
excite the appetite, without vomiting, and increase the urinary
discharge.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">To Cleanse the Blood from Mercury.</span>&mdash;Put four ounces,
of the powdered root of may apple into one gallon of metheglin;
dissolve four ounces of Epsom salts in a quart of the
liquor, made warm, and mix all together; shake the vessel
frequently, and let it stand for a week. The patient may take
a wine glass full of the above liquor, once or twice a day, according
to its effects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span></p>

<p>Take the leaves and roots of skunk cabbage, of each eight
ounces, bruise in a mortar, and boil them in two pounds of
hog’s lard, for four hours; then press it through a hair sieve or
canvas, and mix in it one ounce of pulverized roll brimstone.
The parts affected must be rubbed with this ointment, before
the fire, for ten minutes every night and morning, and covered
with flannel, using the warm bath twice a week, in the
spring of the year. After all the pains are removed, the patient
may use tonic medicines, such as fine Columbia root, and
ten grains of the rust of iron, three times a day. Use the
salt water bath twice a week, in the months of June and July,
and have moderate exercise on horse-back, in order to
brace the solids.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Ointment.</span>&mdash;Take pitch pine knots, and saw them into dust;
then boil the dust in water; when well boiled, skim off the
turpentine, and strain the water; then put in equal parts of
rue, saffron, sage and camomile; boil the strength out, strain
the liquid, and put in fresh butter.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Black Jaundice.</span>&mdash;Take a handful of the leaves of artichoke,
bruise, put them in an earthen pot, and pour three
pints of good ale on them; set the pot near the fire, for two
days; strain the liquor, to which add a quart of Tenerife
wine. The patient, if costive, must take a wine glass of this
syrup every morning, for nine mornings, first taking a dose
of anti-bilious pills.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Seven Years’ Itch.</span>&mdash;Take four ounces each of white hellebore
and yellow sharp pointed dock root, and two ounces
of elecampane root; bruise them in a mortar, and boil them
in four quarts of water, down to two; strain the decoction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
and while warm, dissolve one ounce of cura sal-amoniac in
the wash; wet the parts with a linen rag, dipped in the lotion,
every night at bed time, and take a teaspoonful of cream
of tartar and flour of sulphur, in molasses, twice a day for
three days, by which time the itch will be cured. This is a
more cleanly method than using greasy ointments, and is an
infallible and safe cure. Put on clean linen and sheets the
fourth night, to prevent a relapse.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Corns on Feet.</span>&mdash;To keep the feet in proper condition,
they should be frequently soaked and well washed; at these
times, the nails of the toes should be pared, and prevented
from growing into the flesh. Corns are the most troublesome
evils connected with the feet; they are of two kinds, soft and
hard. The soft corns are those which grow between the toes;
they may be easily removed by applying ivy leaf, steeped in
vinegar; if the corn be very painful, change the ivy leaves
every morning; the leaf may be steeped for one or two days
before using.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Pleurisy.</span>&mdash;Drink freely of soot tea, half a pint of hot tar
water every hour, or a strong tea of nettles, and the leaves
pounded and applied as a poultice, every day; at night, apply
the white of an egg, mixed with sulphur.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Weakness.</span>&mdash;Half pound spikenard root, half pound Solomon’s
seal, quarter pound tamarac bark, and quarter pound
lungwort; boil in one gallon rain water ten minutes, then let
them steep six hours; strain, and add half pound loaf sugar
and half pint best Holland gin. Take a wine glass full three
times a day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Loss of Appetite and Debility.</span>&mdash;Take one pint of white
pine bark, tamarac bark, and spikenard root, and one ounce
spruce gum; boil all together in three quarts and a half rain
water, fifteen minutes, then strain and add half pint molasses;
boil six minutes, then let it cool. Drink half a teacup full
morning and evening; if there is no heat, add half pint best
brandy.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Small Pox.</span>&mdash;Make a warm tea of saffron and catnip, and
give the patient; immerse the feet in weak ley, and wash the
body or surface three times a day.</p>

<p>Give also the follow
ing: take one ounce mandrake, ten
grains bitter root, four grains blood root, ten grains sassafras
bark, and half ounce Turkey rhubarb; put all into one quart
boiling water, and let them steep four hours; stir frequently,
then strain. Give a child one year old, a teaspoonful four or
five times a day&mdash;to others, according to age and constitution.</p>

<p>Bathe the head with tepid vinegar and water; if the throat
is sore, gargle with sage and hyssop, sweetened with honey;
when excessive restlessness prevents the rising and filling of
the pox, give a teaspoonful of the syrup of poppies, in a little
catnip tea, every five or six hours; and if purple spots appear
among the pox, give yeast inwardly, and apply strong poultices
to the feet.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Cough or Whooping Cough.</span>&mdash;Take one ounce each colt
foot, St. John’s wort, spikenard, elecampane root, and mullen
leaves; let them boil half an hour slowly, then add half an
ounce Indian physic, or American ipecacuanha, pulverized;
stir often, and steep for four hours; then squeeze, strain, and
add one pint of pure honey. Give as often as required, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
a teaspoonful to a tablespoonful. It will loosen the phlegm
and heal the lungs, is very sudorific, and good for all coughs
or colds.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Injections.</span>&mdash;Take weak thoroughwort tea, one pint milk,
half pint molasses, and half a wine glass full oil&mdash;olive oil is
generally used, but hen’s oil is equally as good; for a child,
use less. This is excellent in fevers, inflammations, &amp;c.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Asthma.</span>&mdash;Ether, tincture of castor, and opium, equal parts;
mix all together, and take a teaspoonful when the symptoms
appear, as often as required.</p>

<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Pleurisy.</span>&mdash;Drink freely of wind root (otherwise called
lung root or pleurisy root), and make a syrup of the following:
take one ounce each wild cherry bark, white ash bark,
poplar bark and red ozier bark, and half ounce each culver
root, sassafras bark and mandrake root; put all in three quarts
warm water, boil ten minutes, then steep three hours; strain,
and bottle. Drink a wine glass full mornings, and half a teacupful
at bed time.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Spitting Blood.</span>&mdash;Take four ounces fresh comfrey root, the
same quantity fresh burdock root, two ounces red willow bark,
one ounce parsley, and two ounces yarrow tops; boil these
ingredients in four quarts water and one quart new milk, to
the consumption of three quarts; strain it, and take one gill
of this decoction, well sweetened with loaf sugar, three times
a day.</p>

<p>It is also beneficial in curing the fluor albus, or whites, in
weakly females. The root of comfrey is good for all fluxes,
and a bad smell in urine. Take four ounces comfrey, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
one ounce tormentil root, boil them in two quarts and a half
water, ten minutes; then strain, and add a gill of best brandy
and half pound loaf sugar. A gill or a common teacup full
may be taken by an adult, night and morning, or as often as
necessary; a child may take a tablespoonful, as often as required.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Salt Rheum.</span>&mdash;Take a large handful plain or white clover,
red clover, and common plantain; put them in two quarts of
urine and one quart of beef brine, for six hours&mdash;let them
be only warm, not hot; then squeeze them well, strain and
put up for use. Wash the parts affected night and day, with
a clean linen rag; drink freely of fishes mouth, or what is
called balmony, and take, twice a week, one teaspoonful of
powdered mandrake root, at bed time.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Epileptic Fits, or Hysterical Affections</span>.&mdash;Take ladies’
smock, dry the leaves, and keep them in a bottle; when wanted,
take a teaspoonful of the leaves, and steep in a half teacup
boiling water. Give, when required, as often as necessary.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">After Pains in Child Birth.</span>&mdash;To relieve them, take a
tablespoonful of Epsom salts, and put it in half a pint hot
water; take half of it, and in the course of two hours take the
remainder, if the patient is very costive, if not, take less;
then take a teaspoonful of devil’s bit (otherwise called blazing
star root), in a little weak tanzy tea; if faint, put in it some
gin or brandy. You can administer this dose every three
hours, if required. It seldom fails of giving instant relief
and is an excellent gargle for a sore mouth, sore throat, or
scrofula.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Pregnant Ladies.</span>&mdash;Take one quart of butternuts, when
green and so soft that you can run a needle into them, one
ounce ginger root, and three pints molasses; boil them at
least half an hour, slowly. Take one three times a week,
and drink frequently of slippery elm bark, steeped in water.
If this is unpleasant, put in a few sumach berries, a little
black birch bark, or a small quantity of tanzy, merely to give
a flavor.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">To Remove a Film on the Eye.</span>&mdash;Take equal quantities
fresh celendine and ground ivy juice, and set it on warm ashes,
in a tin vessel, for an hour; strain the sediment from the
clear juice; take a gill of this, and put in half a teaspoonful
of best loaf sugar; bottle it, and wet the spot several times
a day.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Another.</span>&mdash;Take the gall of an eel, and drop a little in
the eye three times a week; then put in one drop of olive
oil, to heal the eye. It has cured, when all other remedies
had failed.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Wild Cucumber.</span>&mdash;This is a forest tree, similar to the poplar;
you will often find them from seventy to eighty feet high.
There are other species of the cucumber which are evergreen,
but the leaves of this are deciduous, oval, acuminate, and pubescent
beneath. It produces a fruit bearing some resemblance,
while green, to a small cucumber; in August, the
fruit turns to a deep red color, and opens; the seeds are red,
and the size of a kernel of corn; they have a bitter taste,
and are quite pungent.</p>

<p>I have used them extensively, and consider them very valuable
in certain forms of diseases, especially where there is a
phlegmatic temperament, or a general relaxed state of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
system. In dropsical affections, I have found the cucumber
to be a superior remedy. The bark of the trunk and root, is
also very valuable; it is somewhat similar to the poplar, yet
it is more diuretic and stimulating; it is good in dyspepsia,
or where we want a remedy to increase the tone of the stomach.
I have known and cured many cases of anasarca, and
yellow fever.</p>

<p>Make a tincture of the seeds or bark, and take half a wine
glass full mornings, before dinner, and at bed time. This will
cure the chronic rheumatism. I can safely say it is a very
valuable medicine in all families, as it possesses tonic, stimulant,
and diuretic properties.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">For Dropsical Patients</span>&mdash;a teaspoonful of the powdered
bark or seeds, mixed with honey, and taken mornings and at bed
time, will produce a cure. Drink plentifully of dwarf elder
bark tea, as a common beverage.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Family Pills.</span>&mdash;Take four ounces black root, and half an
ounce each cayenne and mandrake root, pulverized; make an
extract of these together by moderate warmth, straining during
the time of preparing, and bring the substance to the
consistency of tar; then add equal parts of pulverized gum
gamboge, and natural extract of lobelia&mdash;one tenth as much
as there is of the above compound extract. Previous to making
into pills, work into the mass seven drops of oil of spearmint;
then form your pills with magnesia, to the size of a
pea. Take from one to four or five, night and morning. It
would be well to take them nine days in succession, beginning
with less, and increasing if necessary. They can be relied on,
and are excellent to take in the spring and autumn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">St. Anthony’s Fire, or Canker Sore Throat.</span>&mdash;Take eight
ounces of beech drops, put them into four quarts cold water,
boil down to two quarts and sweeten with loaf sugar; after
proper evacuations, patients subject to the rose or erysipelas,
may take a teacup full of this, four times a day; apply clean
linen rags, wet with the decoction not sweetened, over the
inflamed parts, until perfectly well. Do not take the above
when your courses are flowing, or when you expect them.
The above is an excellent wash for children that are chafed,
either in the neck or groins; wash the parts affected as often
as necessary, using a clean cloth; the cleaner the cloth you
wash any sore with, the sooner it will heal; never use the
same cloth on any sore twice; it ought to be instantly washed
in clean water, before using the second time.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Carbuncles.</span>&mdash;Take equal parts beth root and blood root,
powdered fine and mixed with honey; bind it over the carbuncle,
and renew it every two hours. Make a purge of the
following: take a handful each of thoroughwort, tanzy, and
tamarack bark, one ounce culver root, half ounce mandrake,
ten grains sassafras bark, and half ounce angelica seed; put
all together in three quarts cold water; boil seven minutes,
and keep hot nine hours. Take from half a wine glass full
to a whole one, three times a day. Drink, as a common beverage,
a strong tea of princes pine, or red ozier.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Emetic.</span>&mdash;Take a large handful leaves and blows of thoroughwort,
(called by some boneset,) put them into one quart
boiling water, and let them stand near the fire three hours;
then stir, and strain off. Give the patient one gill, as hot as
it can be drank, and if it does not operate in half an hour,
give another, or half the quantity; drink every morning, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
wine glass of the remainder cold, as it is a tonic in all cases
of general debility.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Deafness.</span>&mdash;Take a beaver’s tail, roast it, squeeze out the
oil and apply on cotton. Or, roast a turnip in ashes, squeeze
out the juice, and put four drops, twice a week, into the ear.
Take cleansing syrup daily.</p>

<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Cathartic for Fevers.</span>&mdash;Take half ounce American ipecacuanha,
three ounces culver root, three ounces snake root,
sliced and bruised, and one quart good old rum; keep them
in a covered earthen vessel by the fire, for five days, and
then strain the tincture for use. Dose&mdash;a tablespoonful twice
a day.</p>

<p>As a diaphoretic, in low stages of fever, and in confluent
small pox, when sores appear gangrene, and the powers of
life seem sunk, take the following mixture: four drachms of
bruised snake root, one pint boiling water, two drachms tincture
snake root, four drachms syrup of ginger. Dose&mdash;two
tablespoonsful, to be taken every three hours, in the above
complaint.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Lumbago.</span>&mdash;Take one pound of fresh brake root, or female
fern, one ounce sumach root, cut fine, half ounce culver root,
half ounce mandrake root, and half ounce angelica seed; boil
them in two quarts whiskey, until they become slimy; then
dip cloths in and bind on. Take a tablespoonful nights, inwardly,
and half a wine glass full mornings. Repeat the application
on the spine, very frequently.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Rickets in Children.</span>&mdash;Take one ounce of brake root, or
female fern, cut fine, and pour one quart of boiling water on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
it; sweeten it, and give the child a teacup full four times a
day; if the child is too young to take this dose, give less, according
to age. At the same time, use the decoction in rum,
for bathing the spine and limbs of the child; it would be
well to bathe the child in a spring, every morning in summer.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Scrofulous Swellings.</span>&mdash;Take the inner bark of bayberry
bush, pound it soft, and apply it over the swellings and sores,
nights and mornings. Drink a strong tea made of bayberry
leaves&mdash;a teacup full four times a day.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Wind, or Cholic.</span>&mdash;Take one ounce of bayberry berries,
bruise them well, and half ounce masterwort seed, well pulverized
or bruised; infuse them in three pints of best cogniac
brandy for a week, and shake the bottle frequently. Take a
half wine glass full in the same quantity warm water, twice
a day, on an empty stomach; if necessary, take it three times
a day.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Indian Remedy for Fevers.</span>&mdash;I find the Indians more
incident to fevers, than any other disease, and they rarely fail
to cure themselves, by sweating, and then plunging themselves
into cold water, which, they say, is the only way not to catch
cold. I once saw an instance of this kind. Being in search
of a particular root, at the Lake of the Two Mountains, about
thirty miles from Montreal, I called on an Indian chief, and
found him ill of a fever; his head and limbs were apparently
much affected with pain; his wife was preparing a bagnio, or
bath, for him. The bagnio resembled a large oven, into which
he crept by a door; on the side opposite the door was a hole,
in which she put hot stones. She fastened the hole up as
closely as possible, to prevent the least air entering therein.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
While he was sweating in his bagnio, his wife was preparing
his road to the lake. This was in August, 1835&mdash;a very cold
season; in less than half an hour, he was in so great a sweat
that when he came out, he was as wet as if he had come out
of a river, and the steam from his body was so thick, that it
was hard to discern his form or face, although I stood near
him. In this condition, naked, a body cloth only excepted,
he ran to the river, about thirty paces distant, ducked himself
two or three times, and returned, passing through his bagnio,
to mitigate the severe shock of the cold, to his own house,
perhaps twenty paces further, and, wrapping himself in his
woolen mantle, lay down at full length near a long, but gentle
fire in the middle of his wigwam&mdash;turning himself several
times, till dry; he then arose, and began getting dinner ready
for us, seeming to be as easy and as well as either of us.</p>

<p>The squaws wash their new-born babes in cold water, as
soon as they are delivered, often repeating the same healthy
operation. I have recommended cold water to a number of
weak females, during pregnancy, and they have borne up with
a vigor scarcely less wonderful than that of the Indian woman.</p>


<p class="prcp"><span class="smcap">Hardihood of Indian Women.</span>&mdash;The great power of endurance
which the Indian woman of the forest, uncontaminated
by the blighting influence which civilization often introduces
among them, many have noticed. Every one has read the
account of their remarkable health, during pregnancy and
child-birth. Washington Irving, in his “Astoria,” in giving
an account of a journey, through the dreary deserts lying
between the Snake and Columbia Rivers, says:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>
<p>“And here we cannot but notice the wonderful patience,
perseverance, and hardihood of the Indian woman, as exemplified
in the conduct of the poor squaw of the interpreter.
She was now far advanced in pregnancy, and had two children
to take care of&mdash;one four, and the other two years of age.
The latter, of course, she frequently had to carry on her back,
in addition to the burdens usually imposed upon the squaw;
yet she had borne all her hardships without a murmur, and
throughout this weary and painful journey, had kept pace
with the best pedestrians. Indeed, on various occasions, in
the course of this enterprise, she displayed a force of character
that won the respect and applause of the white man.”</p>

<h3>FORMATION OF THE CHEST.</h3>

<p>The chest is formed by the back bone behind, the breast
bone in front, and the ribs, which go from the back bone to
the breast bone. Seven of the ribs are long, and five short;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
the five lower are the short ribs, and they are united to the
breast bone by an elastic cartilage; by this construction, the
chest is made flexible.</p>

<p>Now that I have explained the formation of the lungs, we
will look in and see what it contains&mdash;the lungs and heart.</p>

<p>The lungs are wedge-shaped&mdash;the small ends being up
under the collar bone, while the base, or larger part, is at the
bottom, turned down heavily in the midriff. The lungs are
attached to the wind-pipe, and larger air vessels and blood
vessels, these likewise being connected to the back bone with
cartilages. The lungs float downward into the midriff, and
against the ribs or the side of the chest, every time the air is
drawn into the chest. They are divided into two parts, on
each side of the chest, something like a sponge, full of cells;
the most correct resemblance of these cells, or vacancies,
would be, in my opinion, a thick branch of some shrub, very
full of the minutest berries you can conceive of, and without
leaves; you must imagine the shrub as hollow, through all
its branches and twigs, until quite into the cells; then cut the
extremity of all the twigs, until you bring it to a wedge shape,
and weave something like a spider web, to cover the cells, so
that nothing but the air or blood can pass through, to be
renewed.</p>

<p>The heart is in front, between the two tubes of the lungs.
It is likewise wedge-shaped, the base, or larger end being up,
while the small end points downward, slanting into the left
chest; it occupies one-third more room in the left chest than
in the right, measuring from the centre of the breast bone,
under which the heart is placed, towards the middle of the
breast bone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>This important organ is little known, and I wish to explain
its offices and revolutions, in a comprehensive manner, that
all may understand it.</p>

<p>We have three different kinds of blood vessels; the largest
vein is called vena cavæ; the smaller veins are called capillaries
and arteries; every time you prick yourself, you open a
capillary vein. On the right side is the vena cavæ, one part
descending and the other ascending, but both meeting on the
right side; this brings all the contaminated blood from all
parts of the body; from thence it empties into the right ventricle,
then to the right auricle, pushes on to the pulmonary
artery, through the lungs, to be purified, returns with velocity
to the left auricle, and then to the left ventricle. There are
thousands and tens of thousands little arteries, that carry the
blood to all parts of the body.</p>

<p>I will quote a report from Dr. Edwards. He had been
speaking of the wonderful distribution of the blood, in the
little arteries, when he added:</p>

<p>“Along on the lines of these little tubes or canals, (the
arteries,) through which the blood with all its treasures flows,
God has provided a vast multitude of little organs, or waiters,
whose office is each one to take out of the blood, as it comes
along, that kind and quantity of nourishment which it needs,
for its own support, and also for the support of that part of
the body which is committed particularly to its care. And,
although exceedingly minute and delicate, they are endowed
by their Creator with the wonderful power of doing this, and
also of abstaining from, or of expelling and throwing back
into the common mass, what is unsuitable, or what they do
not want, to be carried to some other place where it may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
needed; or, if it is not needed anywhere, and is good for
nothing, to be thrown out of the body as a nuisance.</p>

<p>“Now let us follow these little organs, as they fly upward,
to carry support to the hair, to make it grow. But, as they
proceed upward, the ears will want serum&mdash;the eyes will want
something for the eye-balls, and the organs about the eye will
take that and work it up into the eyes, and cause them to
grow; then proceed on to your joints, and along the bones,
muscles and nerves; the joints want strength&mdash;it is a fluid
called synovia, in physiology; then proceed to your finger
nails.”</p>

<p>So you see the whole system is supported by the blood;
all these vessels or supports go to every organ in the body,
and are called secretions; if these secretions are obstructed
by disease, they cannot perform their regular routine, or office,
and the parts will gradually become infirm. The blood carries
little atoms, or particles, to make all parts of the body
grow, and which, you may perceive, are necessary to replace
the atoms which are worn off by friction, in our motion, as
there is a constant waste in every part of the body, or system.</p>

<p>Now let me return to the heart. It is not larger than a
man’s fist, and is strong and muscular. It is, as I said before,
situated slanting, or obliquely; both sides of the heart fill in
the same instant, and then contract, shrink, and compresses,
with as much force as a strong man could press it with his
hand. Such is the admirable circulation of the blood, that
this revolution goes regular, one hundred thousand times in
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>How can we but admire the creation of such a beautiful
machine! Then consider how much resistance this poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
heart has to overcome, in sending blood to all parts of the
body, and the many obstructions in its way, which causes it
to stop its motion, or it will quiver and throb, according as it
is repulsed by those obstructions. How many there are who
say, “My heart is diseased&mdash;the physician says so.” Now,
my friends, not in one case of ten is the heart diseased; but
it is obstructed in its revolutions, by not being able to send
the blood through these little vessels, to all parts of the body;
they are crooked, and the least impediment must necessarily
cause agitation, or stop this great propeller.</p>

<p>There is a strong partition between the right and left sides
of the heart, so that the right auricle and right ventricle,
with their blood, brought back from the veins, can have nothing
to do with the blood in the left auricle and left ventricle;
it is, indeed, as if there were two hearts, placed side by side,
and pressed closely together. We know not how the heart
is kept in motion, nor can the wisest anatomist or physiologist
in the world tell us; we know that the lungs have something
to do in the case, and, when once set a-going, we can form
some idea of what keeps it in motion&mdash;but, after all, the real
causes of the continued movement of either the heart or
lungs, has ever been a great mystery, and may possibly always
remain so.</p>

<p>Our bones, nerves, and muscles receive life and nourishment
from the blood; then how necessary it should be pure
and clean. As the blood is made from our food, we should
be careful as to the quality and quantity, eating only what is
conducive to health, which surely will promote happiness.
Strong spices, hot bread, rich pies and cakes, salt pork and
beef, are injurious eating at all hours of the day, especially at
bed time, and is contrary to the laws of nature. Some may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
laugh, and say, “Why, I eat half a mince pie, and half a
dozen pickles, every night, and yet I am well.” You may
tantalize your digestive organs for a while, but remember,
your gratifying your unnatural appetite, will be repaid by
years of pain and distress. Be rational beings; eat to live,
and not live to eat.</p>

<p>Mothers, as a general thing, feed their children too often;
even if you nourish your child with the breast, it should be
regular&mdash;not twenty times a day, and all night. This is very
wrong; you bring your little ones up gluttons, and, as soon
as they are weaned, they will be continually crying for something
to eat&mdash;never satisfied. Always be regular in eating
your own meals, and giving the same to your children, if you
wish them to be healthy; as a general rule, give them food
according to your own judgment&mdash;not too much. I think
many a poor child has been murdered, by an over fond mother
giving it all it wanted, and not using that judgment which
was required, because the child cried. O! mothers, be firm,
wise, and prudent, in raising those tender plants; remember,
if the digestive organs are too weak, the child will fall into
fits. Let a child eat mashed potatoes; all vegetables are
better, and give more nourishment, than cakes and pies; a
little lean meat, is healthy for a child. In our food, we all
want a change; but let all be well cooked, well baked, and
plainly seasoned.</p>

<p>Now let me go back, and say a little in regard to the nerves
and bones. The nerves derive their support from the blood,
but not entirely, for the nerves may be weakened by other
causes; still they depend on the blood, in a measure, for support.
For instance, a lady may fall and break her back bone,
or spine; now this is the seat of the nerves; they all branch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
out from the spine, and, of course, all the nerves are affected;
perhaps the pain would be most severe at the extremity of the
nerves. Many able and eminent physicians have been baffled,
in procuring ease to their patients, as there was no pain
where the parts were injured, but at the extremity of the
nerves.</p>

<p>The digestive organs depend entirely upon the nerves for
support; therefore, never irritate the spine by blistering, as
it injures every nerve. Everything that is applied to the
spine&mdash;plasters, bathing, or drops, should be of a cooling
nature, and at the same time strengthening, and never irritating,
as it only makes you worse; I never saw any good effect
derived from it. If you want to irritate, draw from the spine,
by putting blisters on the thighs or legs, not to the spine or
head; let your motive be, in all cases, to draw downward.</p>

<p>How do the joints derive support from the blood? It is
the secretion we call in physiology, synovia. It serves the
same purpose as the grease which men use for wheels, to prevent
their making a noise; so, when this secretion is obstructed,
or the circulation irregular, the ligaments and muscles
find no support, and consequently they become stiff and inactive;
call it rheumatism, if you like, or weak joints. Sometimes
the bones become crooked and deformed, which is often
caused by mercury, or by scrofula, which creates heat, and
absorbs all the nourishment from them. Sometimes the muscles
become stiff; in all such cases, cleanse the blood, and rub
in hemlock tincture; you will find, in this book, very good
bathing drops.</p>


<h3>THE DIAPHRAGM.</h3>

<p>Now that I have explained the circulation of the blood, and
showed you the contents of the chest, I will proceed to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
midriff. The contents of the chest are separated from the
abdomen, by a floating curtain, called the midriff, or diaphragm.
The midriff is the floor of the lungs; the right and left portions
are loose, and float upward into the chest every time we
breathe out the air in the chest; on breathing, or drawing
in the air, the midriff of a person in health, forms a floor to
the lungs and heart, and it descends until it is drawn tight,
flat and stiff, across the body. The arrangement of the midriff
is such, as always to form a strong support to the heart
and lungs, as it floats below the lungs, every time we empty
the air out from the chest.</p>

<p>The midriff is united, or fastened to the back bone, breast
bone, and the middle of the ribs; therefore, we say the right
and left portions float upward into the chest. How often is
this part strained, and then called consumption! I allow
there may be a cough, and tightness across the chest; but the
real cause is, the lungs have lost their support, and consequently
they wither and decay, unless you can strengthen the
floor or support, that is, the ligaments; the symptoms are,
you are unable to draw a long breath; if you go up stairs,
your breath becomes short.</p>

<p>How many of you have had relations or some female friend,
whom you considered near dying of consumption, but fortunately
became pregnant; and she, to your astonishment, enjoyed
better health than for years previous. But how could
it be so? Why, this is the cause: as soon as the fœtus rose
from the vagina, it supported the midriff, and pushed up the
floor of the lungs, and the poor patient found instant relief;
she could breathe freely, could walk easily, her cough ceased,
and her sleep was calm. But alas! as soon as parturition
takes place, her symptoms all return, and, as no one understands
her case, she must die, through ignorance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>Young men very often sprain their midriff, by lifting, or in
wrestling, and frequently die of consumption, when, by a little
care and judicious treatment, they might be saved. In the
first place, your lungs hang on your wind-pipe, air vessels,
and blood vessels; now, if so, they want a support, and the
midriff is this support; but if it is gone, do not be surprised
if you decap a blood vessel, and thereby spit blood from
that cause; but be not frightened to death by this, as it will,
in many cases, relieve you and be beneficial in the end.</p>


<h3>THE GULLET.</h3>

<p>The gullet is the food pipe; it passes through the chest,
from the back part of the mouth, along the back bone; its
shape is tolerably regular, until it passes the contents of the
chest; then it opens into a spacious apartment, called the
stomach; it lies across the body, leaning to the left side; it
is more like a bag, than anything I can describe; it is very
close to the diaphragm, and one would suppose the diaphragm
rested on it. The stomach of an adult, will hold from one
to three pints.</p>


<h3>THE LIVER.</h3>

<p>This is the largest gland in the human body. It lies on
the right side, under the right breast; the gall bladder is
attached to the liver, and there is also a communication with
the stomach; the gall bladder is the size of your thumb, and
is called secretion, or bile; if we have too much, it overflows,
and causes jaundice, sick headache, gall-stones, and many
other diseases, which cannot be cured, unless you commence
by cleansing your blood. As the liver is a gland it can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
diseased in various ways; it can be ulcerated, and may contain
grubs, or worms.</p>


<h3>THE ABDOMEN.</h3>

<p>This contains the intestines, and commences from the stomach;
that part the ancients used to call the second stomach,
is now termed duodenum; this turns downward and backward,
toward the right side, there it turns again to the left,
and I may say, zig-zags, until it joins the larger intestines; both
ends of the large intestines, are tied to the back bone, to
keep them from floating; the lower end passes through the
basket of the hips, to the end of the back bone, to keep it in
its right place; this forms the back passage, and the end of
the back bone is called the rectum. The bowels move; and
if so, how often you injure yourself by not obeying the calls
of nature to evacuate them; you put it off to some more
convenient time; but nature will not be baffled with impunity&mdash;you
must suffer for your omission the next day, or day
after; the head is afflicted, and you go to your closet, force
and strain to accomplish what you refused nature at the suitable
time; as the intestines float, will you not cause debility
and disease? Yes, surely you will; then, of course, you have
recourse to physic, and this makes you worse, as the intestines
become coated. Now for the results; as I said before,
the large intestines pass through the basket of the hips; they
are straight along the bone, when in a healthy condition, but
by this forcing and straining, they become drawn down, in a
wrinkled condition, and there is no action; thence arises costiveness,
constipation, piles, ulcers, fistulas, and numerous other
diseases, which assail these parts, through neglecting the calls
of nature. And here I would observe, in regard to your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
children, be watchful; I have been told by girls from six to
twelve years old, how they have been so costive, that they
would have to force themselves to such a degree, that every
object around them appeared black. O! what poor miserable
beings will they be all their lives, through a mother’s neglect.
Never let a young child sit too long on a vessel or
chair; it weakens the intestines, and brings on general debility.
I have known many to die in fits, and to have the
relaxation of the fundament, merely by sitting too long on a
stool chair.</p>


<h3>THE KIDNEYS.</h3>

<p>The kidneys are not in the box of the hips, but above it,
in the small of the back, on each side of the back bone.
Their office is to separate the salt, earth, and surplus water,
from the blood; there is a chamber to each kidney, into which
the water is first poured; from each of these chambers, there
is a pipe, or tube, that passes downward to the bladder; this
tube is called, in physiology, the ureter. The kidneys seem
to be a sort of sieve, or filter, with this difference, however:
while a sieve permits only the finest and best part to pass
through it, the kidneys filter out the worse, or coarser parts;
these are carried to the bladder, whence they are conveyed
immediately out of the system. In a natural and healthy
state, the proper time when the bowels should be evacuated,
is indicated by nature; should the water be retained, and the
voice of nature disobeyed, the effects are these: as in the
bowels, it will lessen the action of the bladder and kidneys,
and what you retain, does more injury than you can possibly
imagine; your kidneys become coated by retention&mdash;thence
come gravel, stone, stoppage of the urine, and various other
diseases of the kidneys and bladder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>

<p>Never trifle with nature. What pain and suffering might
be averted, if all would obey the first call of nature! By
retention of the urine, a bad odor arises from the body; what
you retain in the bladder, is emitted from the pores in a measure,
and your perspiration is very offensive. Mothers ought
to instruct their children in regard to this important call of
nature. I have found, in my practice, a great number who
habituated themselves to retain the water in the bladder all
day, that is, from morning to bed time; and what miserable
looking objects they were; their countenances were sallow,
and the skin dry and withered, although young in years.</p>

<p>The kidney may be ulcerated, and contain grubs, as well
as the liver, it being likewise a gland, but much smaller than
the liver. You can injure the kidneys by food, as all water
or liquids go immediately to the kidneys; sweet spices and
all acids should be avoided, as they coat the kidneys, and
cause the gravel; the ureter, or pipe which takes the water
to the bladder, finally gets filled and obstructed, so the water
cannot pass thence.</p>


<h3>BASKET OF THE HIPS.</h3>

<p>The bony walls of the hips are very strong and solid. The
only part that is movable, is the lower end of the back bone,
in front; behind the cross bone is the bladder, next comes
the womb, and behind this is the back passage.</p>


<h3>THE WOMB AND ITS APPENDAGES.</h3>

<p>The womb is pear-shaped&mdash;the large end being uppermost,
and the small end, or mouth, downward, and connected with
the neck of the vagina. It hangs on four crotchets, or hooks,
which are the upper ligaments to support it; it is also sup<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>ported
by muscles, and from the crown of your head to the
ends of your fingers and toes, there are small fibres connected
with it. I would say to all, be careful not to stretch or reach
the arm higher than its natural limits; a child from seven
years old and upwards, to fifteen, may injure these supporters
by jumping, and swinging at the length of their arms; so the
squaws of the Iroquois tribe assure me, and I have seen a
large number of the most distressing cases of this kind.</p>


<h3>THE OVARIES.</h3>

<p>The ovaries are on each side of the womb, and are a great
support to it; ovaries signify egg vessels, and egg, in physiology,
means ovum. The egg is the beginning of our specie,
or animal life; thence the germ, or seed. The ovaries are
two balls, the size of a small egg, connected with the womb
by a pipe, or tube, called the fallopian tube; this tube, or
passage, carries the ovum to the womb. When menstruation
takes place, the ripening and expulsion of the egg is affected
by a real inflammation, similar to what may be seen when
you run a nail, or piece of wood, into your flesh, when there
will arise an inflammation which will cause it to fester, and
then it is easily removed from the flesh; it is this periodical
irritation, which causes a sympathetic inflammation; at the
beginning of the month, the inflammation is slight, but about
the time the egg is expelled from the vesicles, the inflammation
reaches its height; in order to give relief, the vessels
pour out an abundance of blood, and frequently mucous,
according to the healthy condition of the ovaries. The ovaries
are placed very low in the groins, advancing into the
pelvis. In case of malformation, the menses never appear,
and impregnation is impossible; but I have known females<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
to become mothers at the age of fifteen, and they never saw
their menses; no doubt, if they had not married, it would
have come about in its own time. But here I would remark,
it is frequently colorless in weak, scrofulous constitutions, and
often these obstructions are in the fallopian tube, and falling
of the womb is the principal cause. The periodical discharge
of the blood, I may say, is often from the uterus, through the
vagina, and sometimes from the vagina alone. Menstruation
commences between the ages of fourteen and eighteen; I
have, however, in my practice, found several cases where they
appeared at the age of ten years; but this is not a general
rule, and such cases rarely occur. Usually, the earlier the
menses appear, the sooner they disappear; but, as a general
rule, the menses ought not to depart until at the age of forty-eight
or fifty, and I have known them to continue to fifty-five,
and those females were perfectly well.</p>

<p>As I said before, the mouth of the womb is connected with
the vagina, which signifies a tube, or passage. The vagina is
a very thick wall, capable of dilating and contracting, to a
very great extent; its length is from four, to five, six, and
seven inches, and some anatomists have testified that it is, in
some rare cases, even eight inches long; it is not strait&mdash;its
curve is in front, next to the bladder, while the convex part
is next to the rectum, or larger bowels. I explain this, as
many are led into error, imagining the womb within an inch
of the entrance.</p>

<p>Now, my friends, I have given you a plain description of
your internal organs, and I hope you will overlook its deficiencies;
I have given my descriptions as delicately as possible.</p>


<h3>DISEASE OF THE WOMB.</h3>

<p>I will endeavor to explain to you the diseases of the womb
and ovaries. In the first place, you can injure the womb by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
miscarriages; but previous to this, perhaps the ligaments of
the womb were weak, and the cause of the miscarriage might
be attributed to that. No female should stand on the ends
of her toes and reach, as it injures the womb; all tight lacing
is injurious; by costiveness, you impair the womb; lifting,
beyond your strength, should be avoided. Child-bearing,
or violent labor in child-birth, retention of the after-birth&mdash;all
combine to weaken every muscle and ligament of the
womb, and bring on prolapsus uteri, or falling of the womb.
I have known the womb to be caloused, in several cases; and
as to its falling, as we say, it may be felt more on the rectum
and ovaries, and there will, in these cases, be more pain in
the sciatica joints, or hip bone, and it may press more on the
lower part of the bowels; this is generally brought on by
costiveness; long waists have done their work, as well as
heavy petticoats; all these combine to press down the bowels
and ligaments of the womb; all fall, or bear heavily on the
ureter and fallopian tube, and bring on many distressing diseases,
as leucorrhœa, or whites. I will here explain the cause
of this running, as many are perfectly ignorant of it; in most
cases, it is the weeping of the ovaries; when it is purely white,
we call it weakness&mdash;as a sore or weak eye weeps, so do the
ovaries; and when it changes color, green or yellow, and has
a disagreeable smell, no doubt they are diseased&mdash;either ulcers
in the ovaries, or womb, and the distillation is so acrid, that
it causes itching and smarting in the vagina, and the lips of
it are swelled. There have been, of late, several cases in my
practice, in which the female has communicated the same disease
to her husband&mdash;similar to the clap. But remember, I
have known such cases among the most virtuous, and where
there was not the least taint of any venereal disease in the
system; I do not say but that their blood might be contami<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>nated
with humors; I seldom meet with a person, but has
more or less humors to combat with. And how many have
been injured by mercury, which poisons the blood. Girls may
be troubled with the whites, at from three months to fourteen
years of age. The womb can be ulcerated as well as the
ovaries, and thence comes dropsy, cancers, and various other
diseases; and by this pressing down, in fact, two-thirds die
of consumption, because all the parts are pulled down, from
the midriff, to the liver, intestines, kidneys, womb, and ovaries&mdash;there
is no action&mdash;all is in a debilitated state. Now
what can be done? In the first place, put waists on your
petticoats; then obtain a cleansing syrup&mdash;you will find a
recipe for one in the foregoing pages; then take a piece of
leather, that will cover from the breasts to the pelvis, a quarter
of a yard wide above, but narrower at the bottom, making
a hole in it for the navel; spread it with strengthening plaster,
a recipe for which will be found in this book; drink the
following as a constant beverage: take five roots of sweet
fern, a tablespoonful of dry tanzy, and boil in two quarts of
water; then strain, and drink a tumbler half full twice during
the day.</p>

<p>When the top of the womb falls forward, it infringes on
the back part, and top of the bladder, and every few minutes
you have a desire to evacuate the water; there is a sinking
feeling at the stomach, and pain, or distress, in the bladder.
Sometimes the womb will protrude in, and on the pelvis, and
below, into the front passage; if there is no one near that
understands my mode of treatment in this case, do it yourself;
I learned it from a squaw, and have replaced ten thousand
or more. In the first place, wash it well with cold water,
and hold wet cloths to it; then lay on your back, and put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
it up carefully with your hand, holding or drawing in your
breath; then apply a womb plaster. Never allow a male or
female practitioner to plug your womb; it only destroys it,
and causes ulcers, cancers, and a multitude of other diseases,
in the womb.</p>


<h3>ABORTION.</h3>

<p>It seems to me, every female of common sense&mdash;letting
alone christianity, would shudder at the expression of this
word, if they really knew its definition, or could realize the
extent of the crime. The Boston <i>Scalpel</i> defines the word
“abortionism,” to be “the knowledge and practice of expelling
from the womb the ovum, or fœtus, ere it is matured.”</p>

<p>In this enlightened century, when the gospel is read and
preached in every tongue, can it be possible that we find
women so barbarous, as to destroy the immortal life which
God has given. You may deprive the precious, unborn babe
from coming into this beautiful world, but its spirit will return
to God, who gave it, and arise in judgment against you. Many
females at the present day, exclaim, (and it is a fashionable
saying,) “I could have children, if I choosed, but I will not
be annoyed with them, and my husband dislikes them.” How
unlike the blessed Savior! He took children in his arms,
and blessed them. What were your intentions, in taking
upon you the duties of a wife? Surely, some motive must
have prompted your ambition, or you did not take a realizing
sense of its duties, as it was expressly commanded by God
himself. After He had created Eve, He joined Adam and
Eve together, and said, “Go forth and multiply!” He did
not say, “gratify your carnal passions, and destroy the effects;”
but He said, “replenish the earth.” The fruits of the womb<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
are God’s reward, and He has chosen woman to bring forth
at His command.</p>

<p>No time in the life of woman, can she feel to lift up her
heart and voice, to praise God, with more fervor for his protecting
care, and rejoice in His mercy, than after a safe delivery
of a living babe. She forgets all her suffering, when she
clasps the little innocent to her breast. In ancient times,
miscarriage was thought to be a curse on the female, as it
endangers her life, by bringing on hemorrhage, from the adhesion
of the placenta. There is a difference between miscarriage
and abortion: an exclusion of the fœtus six, and sometimes
seven weeks after the cessation of the menses, is termed
miscarriage; between that and six months, an abortion; and
between that and nine months, premature labor. Sometimes
the fault lies in some deficiency on the part of the ovum.
Abortion may be caused by the inability of the uterus to
distend itself, beyond a certain limit; and this may be imputed
to dress, nine cases out of ten.</p>

<p>Woman was designed by God, as I have said before, to
bring forth; she is, by nature, a producer of her race, intended,
by God, to feed and nourish, with her own blood, the
fœtus, and bring it into the world, an image of God himself,
and of man.</p>

<p>Abortion is unnatural; and many lose their lives, directly
after it, and few gain their strength, as it was previous to it.
And all those preventatives, which are in fashion at the present
day, to baffle the will of God, are an abomination in His
all-seeing eye, and He will repay ten fold.</p>

<p>Kind and beloved woman! preserve thy purity, virtue, and
chastity, and thy days will be many and pleasant upon the
earth; and finally, thou shalt become a chosen angel in
Heaven, to sing the praises of God and the Lamb!</p>

<h3>MASTURBATION.</h3>

<p>Masturbation, or self-pollution, has brought many to an
untimely grave. It is held to with tenacity, because of the
evenescent, fleeting, and animal pleasure derived therefrom.
Mothers, how many of your children could you save, by timely
care, while in their infant state! Teach them chastity; not
to expose their bodies; not to allow the least exposure to sisters,
and never to brothers&mdash;it contaminates the mind; never
allow boys and girls to sleep together. Children never forget
what they hear, as many suppose. How often do we find
mothers, who have no respect for their children, frequently
using the most obscene language in their presence, and sowing
the seeds of impurity. St. Paul says, “Being evil yourselves,
give good gifts to them that ask.” Your children
depend on every word, look, and action; you can form them
as you will&mdash;to virtue, or vice. You can rule the nation!</p>

<p>Never allow your children to sleep with strangers; however
young, they may learn more of impurity in ten minutes,
than you could teach them virtue in years. The reason why
I speak to you of the necessity of having a watchful eye on
your offspring, is that so many young men and women, whom
I have been called to visit, in consumption, and some in a
deranged state, have confessed to me, that they had contracted
an intimacy with a play-mate, who had taught them the act
of self-pollution, and, to their sorrow, had practiced the same
for years, till they had no control of themselves; this brought
involuntary emissions, and thence come leucorrhœa, falling of
the womb, and frequently insanity; the greatest number, as
a general rule, end in consumption. Doctors are too delicate
to mention the cause of this disease, and treat the case, directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
opposite to what it should be, as all the internal organs are
debilitated.</p>

<p>I will relate a very distressing case, which I hope will be a
warning to mothers and daughters:</p>

<p>A daughter of one of the first families of Springfield, Massachusetts,
a few years ago, was pronounced by all the physicians
of that city, to be in a consumption. I was called on,
by a friend of the family, and requested to visit the young
lady, at her special request, immediately. I lost no time, but
went instantly, and what a pitiful object I beheld! A living
skeleton&mdash;a fearful picture of self-pollution! I desired all to
quit the apartment, and this poor child confessed her weakness;
she was willing to die, she said, if she could atone for
the trouble and expense she had brought on her parents.
Now what was to be done. I well knew her debility was too
great to depend on tonics, and to save her, I must gain her
confidence and love. I left her, and returned soon after, got
her permission to divulge the secret to her mother, and lost
no time, in order to save her from death. She must have
her genital organ cut out; the operation should take place
instantly, as involuntary emissions would soon carry her off,
her debility was so great. But thanks be to God, she is still
living, in the far west; but never can she enjoy the blessings
of married life.</p>

<h2><a name="ROOTS_AND_HERBS" id="ROOTS_AND_HERBS">ROOTS AND HERBS.</a><br />

<small>HOW TO COLLECT AND PRESERVE THEM.</small></h2>

<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/c.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">COLLECT such as are sound and
perfect, and separate from them such
as are injured or decayed. Those
precautions must be taken which
are best fitted for preserving them,
and they should, as a general rule,
be defended from the effects of moisture,
too great heat, or cold, and
confined air. Vegetable matters
should be collected in the countries
where they are indigenous, and those which grow wild in dry
soil and high situations, fully exposed to the air and sun, are,
in general, to be preferred to those which are cultivated, or
which grow in moist, low, shady, or confined places.</p>

<p>Roots which are annual, should be collected before they
shoot out their stalks, or flowers; biennial roots, in the harvest
of the first, or spring of the second year; perennial roots,
either in spring, before the sap begins to mount, or in harvest,
after it has returned. Those which are worm eaten, except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
some resinous roots, or which are decayed, are to be rejected;
the others are immediately to be cleaned, with a brush and
cold water, letting them lie in it as short a time as possible;
the fibres and little roots, when not essential, are to be cut
away. Roots which consist principally of fibres, and have
but a small top, may be immediately dried, if they are juicy,
and not aromatic; this may be done by heat, not 100 degrees
of Fahrenheit; but, if aromatic, by simply exposing and turning
them frequently in a current of dry air; if they are thick
and strong, they should be split or cut into slices, and strung
upon thread; if covered with a rough bark, they may be
peeled fresh, then dried. Such as lose their virtues by drying,
or are directed to be preserved in a fresh state, are to be kept
buried in dry sand.</p>

<p>No very general rule can be given for the collection of herbs
and leaves&mdash;some of them acquiring activity by age, and others,
as the mucilaginous leaves, from the same cause, losing
the properties for which they are efficient. Aromatics are to
be gathered after the flower buds are formed; annuals, not
aromatic, when they are about to flower, or when in flower;
biennials, before they shoot, and perennials, before they flower,
especially if their fibres become woody; they are to be gathered
in dry weather, after the dew is off them, or in the evening,
before it falls, and are to be freed from decayed, withered,
or foreign leaves; they are usually tied in bundles, and
hung up in a shady, warm, and airy place, or spread upon the
floor, and frequently turned; if very juicy, they are laid upon
a sieve, and dried by a gentle degree of artificial warmth, by
the stove.</p>

<p>Sprouts are collected before the buds open, and stalks are
gathered in autumn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

<p>Barks and woods are collected when the most active part
of the vegetable are concentrated in them, which occurs in
spring and in autumn; spring is preferred for resinous barks,
and autumn for others, which are not resinous, but rather
gummy. Barks should be taken from young trees. Among
the resinous woods, the heaviest, which sink in water, are
selected; the alburnum is to be rejected.</p>

<p>Flowers are collected in dry weather, before noon, but after
the dew is off, either when they are just about to open, or
immediately after they have opened; of some, the petals only
are preserved, and the colorless claws are even cut away; of
others, whose calyx is odorous, the whole flower is kept.
Flowers which are too small to be pulled singly, are dried
with part of the stalk, and are called heads, or tops. Flowers
and herbs are to be dried by the gentle heat of a stove, or
common fire, in such quantities at a time, that the process
may be finished as quickly as possible&mdash;for by this means
their powers are best preserved, the test of which is the perfect
preservation of their natural color; when they lose their
color and smell, they are unfit for use.</p>

<p>Seeds and fruits, unless when otherwise directed, are to be
gathered when ripe, but before they fell spontaneously. Some
pulpy fruits are freed from their core, and seeds are strung on
thread, and dried artificially; they are, in general, best preserved
in their natural coverings, although some, as the colacynth,
are peeled, and others, as the tamarind, preserved fresh.
Many of these are apt to spoil, or become rancid; and as they
are then no longer fit for medical use, no very large quantity
of them should be collected at a time.</p>

<p>The proper drying of vegetable substances, is of the greatest
importance. It is often directed to be done in the shade,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
and slowly, that the volatile and active particles may not be
dissipated by too great heat. But this is an error; for they
always lose infinitely more by slow than by quick drying.
When, on account of the color, they cannot be exposed to
the sun, and the warmth of the atmosphere is insufficient,
they should be dried by an artificial warmth, less than 100
degrees of Fahrenheit, and well exposed to a current of air.
When perfectly dry and friable, they have little smell, but
after being kept some time, they attract moisture from the
air, and regain their proper odor.</p>

<p>The boxes and drawers in which vegetable matters are
kept, should not impart to them any smell or taste; and more
certainly to avoid this, they should be lined with paper. Such
as are volatile, of a delicate texture, or subject to suffer from
insects, must be kept in well-covered glasses. Fruits and oily
seeds, which are apt to become rancid, must be kept in a cool
and dry, and by no means in a warm or moist place. Oily
seeds, odorous plants, and those containing volatile principles,
should be collected fresh every year; others, whose properties
are more permanent and not subject to decay, will keep for
several years. Vegetables collected in a moist and rainy season
are, in general, more watery, and apt to spoil; in a dry
season, they contain more oily and resinous particles, and keep
much better.</p>

<h3>TYPHOID FEVER.</h3>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_139t.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS disease, which has prevailed
extensively at the west, is treated
under a variety of names&mdash;such as
nervous, putrid, gastrionic, brain
fever, &amp;c.; while the people of this
vicinity, designate it by the name
of slow fever, which, in my opinion,
is about as descriptive of the disease
as any above mentioned. It is most
prevalent during the winter and spring. Patients are variously
affected during the first stages of the disease. Some
are taken with a chill, while others are not conscious of any
such sensations, but merely complain of loss of strength and
appetite; others complain of pain in their head and back. I
have seen some take to their beds, and declare that nothing
was the matter with them, and would insist on the correctness
of their absurd opinions for several days. The pulse soon
becomes small and frequent, the skin hot and dry, while insufferable
thirst continually torments the sufferer. Patients fre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>quently
manifest a strong propensity to sing, while laboring
under it, yet they seldom complain of pain, though delirium
be constantly present, and the bowels morbidly sensitive to
firm pressure. I have seen patients die without complaining
of pain, and yet, on making post mortem examination, satisfactory
evidence was furnished that inflammation of the brain,
the lungs, and the mucuous membrane of the bowels, were
present. These inflammations, therefore, constitute some of
the complications of this disease, while a lack of sensibility,
points to an obtunded condition of the nervous system. Ordinarily,
for four or five days, the disease does not assume an
aggravated appearance, during which time the fever has a
remitting form; but shortly after this, if the patient is not
relieved, the fever becomes continued; and now begin to rise
gradually all the worst symptoms of typhoid fever; the tongue,
which at first was white, or of a yellowish brown color, now
becomes black, dry in the centre, and cracked; the patient
soon falls into a deep coma, and delirium is almost constantly
present. Twitching of the muscles of the face, subsultus-tendinum,
and floccillation, are symptoms which generally
attend this disease.</p>


<h3>BATHING.</h3>

<p>Somebody has said, that God gives shower baths to every
thing that will stay out doors. A very significant hint, this,
to human bipeds; it seems very strange that we are such dull
scholars, in this world. We see the fevered earth parch, and
burn, and fail of its fruits, till the refreshing rain comes down
and cures it; and we never once think, when our blood boils,
our flesh burns, and our skin parches with fever, that the
same blessed medicine that is poured out on the earth, will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
heal us; or, if men get a little theoretical faith of this kind,
they lose it as soon as they become sick. Early superstition,
of all kinds, generally come upon men with peculiar force,
when they are weakened and confused by illness.</p>

<p>There is no more invigorating process for preserving health,
after the inhaling of pure air, than the daily use of the cold
bath. The bath is not useful alone because it removes impurities
from the skin; but the fresh, sparkling water, has an
absolute life in it, which we receive. And this is the reason
why the bath is so much more useful, when the water is just
drawn from the fountain, than when it is suffered to stand,
and lose its living, or electrical properties.</p>

<p>The best time to take a bath is in the morning, when we
rise. No one should take a cold bath, as if he were lazily
doing an unpleasant duty; and no one can do it long. Beginners
with the bath, should observe the following directions:
Bathe the head and face first; bathe the rest of the body
thoroughly and quickly; then use much friction&mdash;first with
a towel, and then with the hand, or a soft brush; this should
be continued until the subject is in a glow.</p>

<p>Some people think there are so many difficulties in the way
of bathing, that they cannot overcome them, and they believe
they must, perforce, be like the dirty representative to an eastern
legislature, who boasted that he had not bathed for fifteen
years! Let us look at these difficulties, and we shall find
that “where there is a will there is a way.” Anybody, that
is anybody, can surely get a bowl of water, and a sponge, or
towel; with these, he can take a thorough washing, and, if
he has any energy, he can rub the body in a glow with a
brush, a hand towel, or the hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>

<p>There is no preventive of colds equal to this simple process,
repeated every morning. It makes a man feel clean, bright,
and respectable. The use of warm baths, except in particular
cases of illness, is mischievous; they weaken the skin, and
expose the person who takes them, to attacks of colds and
influenza. Still, the occasional use of warm baths for cleaning
the skin, is better than to allow the skin to be dirty. Shower
baths are useful in cases where there is high health, or general
inflammation; where there is full reactive power they are
safe, and not otherwise; where they induce a chill, they are
very hurtful. The indiscriminate recommendation of the
shower bath, is always an evidence of very partial knowledge.
The sponge bath is probably more universally beneficial, and
is safer than any other bath.</p>


<h3>HERB TEA.</h3>

<p>Mr. N. had been married but a few weeks, and his bride
was a lovely and accomplished lady. Her health was perfect;
she had never known, by personal experience, what sickness
is, and they were looking forward to the future with the most
sanguine expectations of happiness. But disappointment is
written upon all earthly hopes, and Mr. N. was not to be an
exception from the general rule. His wife was suddenly taken
with cholera. The family physician was called in, and did
what he could to arrest the disease. But she continued to
grow worse, and a council of doctors was called, to consult
measures for her relief.</p>

<p>Mrs. N. had requested that a friend of hers, who had long
been employed in nursing and doctoring those who had confidence
in her&mdash;a lady of great talent and education in the
art of curing with roots and herbs&mdash;to call in and see her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
As this lady approached the house, and saw the carriages of
the physicians, she became alarmed for the safety of her friend;
but when she entered the house, the silence and sadness that
reigned in that once happy mansion, sent a chill to her heart.
Soon the doctors came out, one by one, and silently left the
house. Mr. N. did not inquire their opinion of the condition
of his wife&mdash;he could read it in their looks. After all had
gone but the attending physician, Mr. N. and the nurse, Mrs.
T., entered the room, where the patient lay, apparently in the
last stage of the disease. The doctor rose from his seat beside
the bed; as Mr. N. advanced and inquired, “Is there no
hope?” he could hardly command his voice to tell that afflicted
man, that his wife must die; and his gushing tears spoke
his sympathy with the sufferer.</p>

<p>Mrs. T. looked for a moment upon the unconscious form of
her friend, then, turning to the doctor, said,</p>

<p>“Tell me, my dear sir, can you do nothing more for this
woman?”</p>

<p>He shook his head, and then turned away.</p>

<p>“Then you are willing,” she continued, “I should do what
I can to make her more comfortable while she lives?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Mr. N.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” repeated the doctor. “If you can do anything
for her comfort, do it, for she cannot stay with us long.”</p>

<p>As he said this, he left the house, and Mrs. T. applied herself
to her task. She directed the friends to get some hot
water, bricks, &amp;c., while she sent a boy for some herbs; she
wrote a note, and requested him to carry it to the man with
whom she had been living. He soon returned with the articles.
What she gave the patient to drink, we do not know;
but we soon saw its effects. The cold sweat was wiped from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
her limbs&mdash;bottles of hot water were placed around her&mdash;a
plaster was applied to her stomach, and, in a short time, she
sank into a sweet sleep, which continued an hour or two, when
she awoke, and began to vomit. The friends were now much
alarmed, and thought she must certainly die. But the joyful
expression of Mrs. T.’s countenance, told them that she, at
least, had no fears of a fatal result.</p>

<p>Through the day and night, the nurse continued her exertions
for her friend; and the next morning, when the kind
and sympathizing doctor came in to look at the corpse, he
was very much surprised to find his patient sitting up in bed,
eating a bowl of porridge!</p>

<p>Turning to the nurse, he asked, “What did you give this
woman?”</p>

<p>“<i>Herb tea, sir!</i>” she answered, in a tone of voice which
forbade further questioning.</p>

<p>Mrs. N. still lives, and, when her children are sick, she gives
them <span class="smcap lowercase">HERB TEA</span>!</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">AS far as I can ascertain, the present
season (1857-8,) has been a remarkable
healthy one, in this portion of
the west. But scientifically, every
few days, some poor sufferer is consigned
to the grave&mdash;but not until
nature has disputed, most resolutely,
every inch of ground, and at last has
been compelled to yield to King
Calomel! It is only a few days
since, a child of ten or twelve years old was laid away, with
a part of the lower portion of its face already fallen off, and
appearances indicating that a large part of the rest would soon
have followed, had not death terminated its sufferings in mercy,
and spared its friends the anguish of beholding the farther
devastations of this most potent “remedy.” In such instances,
the outraged feelings of surviving friends, are usually
quieted with the assurance that “it is the Lord’s will;” and
so these works of iniquity are saddled upon the Supreme Arbiter
of events, and He is made the scape-goat of one of the
most wicked systems that ever cursed the world.</p>

<p>I am sometimes perfectly confounded by the blind bigotry
which possesses the minds of those men, whose business
it is to administer to the wants of suffering humanity. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
does seem as though they thought more of conforming to the
opinions of certain authors, and following the prescribed rules
of a Medical Association, than they do of the lives of their
patients. In their opposition, especially to reform in medical
practice, some of them hesitate not to endanger the life of a
fellow-being, if, by so doing, they can bring obloquy upon that
system to which they are opposed.</p>

<p>These are hard sayings; but I am compelled to believe
them, for it is but a short time since one of the poison-dealers
tried to persuade a patient of mine to eat unripe peaches,
only two days after he had reported him as in a very dangerous
situation, with bilious fever. This same man, was prescribing
for a slight ailment in a stout individual, who was
still able to be about town and attend to his business. This
person ate some of the same kind of fruit, and thought that
it injured him. He told his physician what he had done,
who broke out with an oath, and told him he wondered it had
not killed him. This shows the estimation in which he held
the fruit, which he had told my patient would do him good.
Comments, upon such an act, are unnecessary, or upon a profession
which feels itself obliged to treat with contempt, every
thing not paying homage to its mandates&mdash;no matter how
much it may promise to add to the welfare of mankind, if it
cannot trace its origin within the walls of a legalized inclosure.</p>

<p>Of all men, the physician should be a liberal-minded man&mdash;ever
anxious to learn all that will enable him to be of benefit
to his suffering fellow-creatures. He should never conclude
that he has nothing more to know, or that he can find
all knowledge in any one system, or theory, of practice; he
should ever be ready to learn, from every body. He who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
expects to find out all that can be known, in one train of reasoning,
or round of study, is like a man traveling upon a
circle, who thinks, because he can travel all his life-time upon
that circle, he can consequently visit every place that the
length of his life will permit him to visit. After a while,
some one&mdash;who has learned that, in order to extend his knowledge,
he must strike out a path diverging from that one, so
long traveled&mdash;starts out accordingly in a new direction, and
finds an extent of knowledge and research, of which he never
before dreamed.</p>

<p>Our traveler, who thinks that the old path will lead him to
all that he can ever know, comes around to the new road.
He stops, and asks, “Who made this new track? Was it
the man who marked out the one that I am in?”</p>

<p>“No!” says one; “the path which you are in, tells the
same old story; this new path is a better way. Discoveries
have been made in it, far more valuable than in the one in
which you are, and they have been made by one who does
not believe that your old way is perfect.”</p>

<p>Now see self-confidence, bigotry, and ignorance, encircling
the lips of scorn. “Fools!” says he, and he goes, muttering
vengeance on the “poor deluded fanatics!”</p>

<p>But this state of things cannot always remain. The light
of truth is shining, and is destined to dispel the clouds of
mystery, which have so long covered the pathway to the
grave, of millions of our fellow-men. Men of intellect, science,
and humanity, are engaged in this good cause, and, so
sure as “truth is mighty,” it must prevail. In order, however,
to the accomplishment of this desired event, physicians
must be men of principle, and adhere firmly to that which
they know to be right. In the practice of some, there is too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
much disposition to accommodate the taste and prejudice of
the patient, even at his expense. I was talking with a physician
not long since, who advocated the practice of making
medicine to suit the taste of the patient. Instead of accommodating
his desire too much, in a matter about which he
cannot be a judge, the physician should take that course
which will be most likely to cure him speedily, though the
remedy be not quite so palatable; there should be no tampering
with his whims, to the prolonging of his disease.</p>

<p>This principle cannot be too deeply impressed upon the
mind of every one, while he is receiving his medical education;
for the triumph of our cause, and the rescuing of suffering
humanity from the iron grasp of medical tyranny,
depend upon the integrity of our practitioners, and their strict
adherence to the true principles of practice. In the name of
Humanity, let us not fall into the same vortex of quackery,
which characterizes the practice against which we war!</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A PECULIAR acid, in rheumatic complaints,
is now generally admitted to
secrete, or accumulate, in the system;
and, though this acid is found to pervade
the entire body, yet this form of disease
has been thought to be rather a local complaint&mdash;that
the joints, or parts affected,
are particularly in fault, and the remedies
used are to be of a local, and external character;
or, if general, are particularly to act on
the seat of the pain.</p>

<p>The more we study the human frame, and become familiar
with the organism of the human body, the more convinced
we are that, whenever one organ or function of the system is
deranged, all others feel its effects. In rheumatism, therefore,
we have always discovered that the stomach and liver are
diseased; these notions we have had very well substantiated
by many. The internal irritation, renders the nutritive energy
of certain parts at the periphery, (namely, the fibrous sheaths
and covering of the muscles,) feeble, and their power of resisting
external causes of disease, deficient. When cold and
damp, therefore, are applied to the skin, the blood is driven
thence toward the parts most ready, from their want of organic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
energy, to retain it, and least able to resist its flow. Those
parts are the tissues which have been most violently employed&mdash;the
tissues connected with the organs of voluntary motion,
and the fibrous tissues of the muscles and joints. In some
persons, these tissues are congenitally weak, the hereditary
predisposition exists, and there is morbid sympathy always
existing between them and the centre of nutrition. The
laboring man who keeps his stomach and liver in a constant
state of irritation, with spirituous drinks&mdash;who uses his voluntary
muscles hard and long every day, and is exposed to
all kinds of weather, is the most eligible, and the most frequent
victim of rheumatism; for in him the condition of the
stomach, the limbs, and the exciting cause, meet in all their
strength. Hence, in places where perry and cider abound,
the peasantry are especially subject to rheumatism.</p>

<p>Why the rheumatism seizes one joint or set of muscles,
more than another, we know not, positively; but we do know,
that more or less digestive derangements are present at the
time. I never saw a rheumatic attack, in which such derangements
were not present, previously to its commencement.
How often does it happen that a patient, racked with pain
is instantly relieved by a copious vomiting of bile, or by a
common diarrhœa.</p>

<p>We come to the conclusion, then, that rheumatism is not a
mere inflammatory pain of the sheaths of the muscles, but
has its origin in some digestive irritation&mdash;exhibited by a certain
kind and amount of fibrous inflammation, and this may
be caused by the circulation of this acid blood, in its passage
through the minute cappillaries of the joints and tendons,
since nothing but the white and thin blood can pass through
the circulation of the tendons and ligaments. Perhaps this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
blood may be almost entirely of an acid character; it has no
red particles, and may lack those qualities which render it
subservient to nutrition and assimilation.</p>

<p>If this view of the subject is correct, we readily perceive
how the bleeding, cupping, leeching, and blistering processes,
tend directly to weaken the energy of the organs, and render
them more liable to distension and congestion.</p>

<p>A peculiar odor also arises from the patient, which I have
thought quite symptomatic of the disease, while the evacuations
are thin, dark, watery, and extremely offensive. The eruption
on the skin I have observed, but am not able to say whether
or not it is present in all cases; I have never been able to see
it in negroes, neither do I know whether it is perceptible at
all in such subjects, but I am inclined to the opinion that it
is not. The eruption, as I have observed, is various in appearance.
It consists of small, rosy blotches, of a roundish, or
lenticular shape, scarcely, if at all, raised above the general
surface of the skin on which they appear.</p>

<p>I have observed another eruption in this disease, called
“petechiæ.” This eruption is most perceptible on the chest,
and interior part of the arms. There is still another eruption
which I have frequently observed, but it is not peculiar to this
disease; I have also often observed it in other forms of disease.
It makes its appearance about the neck, and the eruption
varies in size, from a mere point to that of half a pea, and
is filled with a transparent fluid; it looks not unlike large and
small drops of dew, scattered about over the neck; this eruption
I have often observed on negroes.</p>

<p>Shortly after the termination of the disease, and sometimes
even before its termination, the skin commences desquamating.
This desquamation is particularly apt to take place on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
inner surface of the hands, and bottoms of the feet; the hair
also frequently falls off, and even the nails are sometimes shed.
Patients recovering from this disease, frequently have a numbness
of the arms or legs, which sometimes amounts to a complete
paralysis.</p>

<p>Abscesses often form about the thigh, leg, or some other
part, which burrow in the inter-muscular substance, and are
very hard to cure.</p>

<h2 id="THE_INFLUENCE_OF_OPIUM">THE INFLUENCE OF OPIUM.</h2>


<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/m.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MRS. N. was the wife of a clergyman
of high standing in the denomination
to which he belonged. She
was a worthy woman, and, as things
are viewed by finite eyes, deserved
a better fate than it was her fortune
to meet. Some years previous to
my acquaintance with her, she had
a severe illness, and opium was
freely prescribed, notwithstanding
the opposition of her husband to its use. Being naturally of
a nervous temperament, he feared that she would find it hard
to relinquish a powerful stimulant, if she once became accustomed
to its use. On her recovery, his fears were fully realized;
for some time, she continued to take her daily dose; but
at length her husband felt that the habit must be broken up,
or her usefulness would be entirely destroyed. It would
never do to have the <a id="parson153"></a>parson’s wife
an opium-taker, and he told her that she must give it up,
for he should not get her any more.</p>

<p>As soon as she had used up what she had on hand, she was
seized with vomiting and diarrhœa, which continued for one
day, when she began to grow cold. Through the following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
night, the chills continued to increase, and toward morning
she was taken with fainting. She could not retain a particle
of food, or anything else, except brandy and water, on her
stomach. By daylight, her strength was nearly exhausted,
and she looked more like a corpse than a living person. It
was a serious question with her husband, whether he should
not send and get her some opium; but, as he was obliged to
leave home on business, he resolved to wait until his return,
and see if she would not get along without it.</p>

<p>As soon as he was gone, she took a full dose of brandy,
and then started to go to the doctor’s house, which was but a
short distance. She knew the doctor’s wife would supply her
with what she wanted; but she did not dare to send one of
her children, for she knew that they partook too much of
their father’s spirit. She succeeded in reaching the door, and
then fainted. The doctor’s wife, being aware of the real state
of things, soon found means to relieve her, and she returned
home, comparatively comfortable.</p>

<p>When her husband returned home, he was rejoiced to find
her so much better, and he remarked that, as she had now
began to amend without opium, he hoped she would not be
compelled to use it again. This was a damper to her spirits,
for which she was not quite prepared, as she had not thought
of the results of her deception. But she was unwilling to
mar her husband’s happiness by telling him the truth; so she
permitted him to believe that she was, in reality, dispensing
with the accustomed stimulus.</p>

<p>Months passed away, and she continued the secret indulgence.
At length, the doctor and his wife suddenly left home,
and she was again in great trouble. No opium could she get,
without the assistance of her husband; and to acquaint him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
with her real condition, was not to be thought of. For two
days she was very sick, and her husband thought she would
die. A physician was called, but was desired not to give
opium, lest she should again be brought under its influence.
His prescription did her no good, and, finding she must die
as she was, she requested to have a friend sent for, to whom
she revealed her secret.</p>

<p>This woman was one of the few who have the moral courage
to do right. Fearless of consequences, she went immediately
to Mr. N., and told him of the apparent danger of one
so dear, and finally procured what was wanted, for that time;
but no entreaties could induce him to purchase a quantity, to
keep in the house. What should she do now? Her eldest
son was just married, and his wife was a kind, affectionate
daughter, and a good nurse; she understood the cause of her
mother’s suffering, but could not comprehend why the remedy
was so cruelly withheld. She resolved to provide it herself,
little suspecting what terrible results would follow such kindness.</p>

<p>Mrs. N. had given up in despair, and resigned herself to
what seemed inevitable death, when her son’s wife came in
with a largo bottle of laudanum in her hand, and presented
it to her. She received it with that joy which can never be
expressed by words, or in any degree comprehended, by one
who has not passed through the horrible suffering which
opium prepares for its victims.</p>

<p>Again she was able to fill her place as a pastor’s wife, and
for many years she continued her course of deception, on
which she had almost unconsciously entered. But it could
not always last; her health declined&mdash;her mind became more
and more feeble, until it seemed as though her intellectual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
faculties were almost destroyed. As the disease increased, she
increased her use of opium, until she found herself in the iron
grasp of consumption! Still, she thought opium would
eventually relieve her, if she only took enough. With this
idea, she one day swallowed a powerful dose. Worn out
nature could no longer contend with so potent an enemy, and
was on the point of giving up the contest. She became
alarmed; a physician was called&mdash;the cause of the trouble
and all the long train of deception brought to light. Much
blame was cast upon the kind-hearted daughter-in-law, and
much did she regret the deplorable results of her mistaken
kindness.</p>

<p>The old doctor, who had been her friend and medical adviser
for years, was now dead, and his place was filled by his
son, who had little sympathy with such as voluntarily give
themselves up to what he considered a sinful indulgence. He
thought that, by breaking up this pernicious habit, he could
again restore her to comfortable health. Her husband and
daughter feared that she had not strength to survive the
loss of her accustomed stimulus; but the doctor assured them
that there was no danger&mdash;that the change in her habits
should be gradual, and that, when once out from under its
influence, she would not feel the need of opium.</p>

<p>He accordingly commenced the Herculean task, which the
inspired writer truly compares to changing the Ethiopian’s
skin, or the leopard’s spots. He gave her a weak solution of
morphine, with other medicines; but it was only a trifle, compared
with the large doses which she had formerly taken.
He had prescribed for her about ten days, when I called to see
her. No language can describe the unutterable anguish depicted
in her countenance! She was reduced to a mere skeleton&mdash;too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
weak to roll from side to side, but every motion indicating
such extreme nervous restlessness, as would have caused
her to do so, if she had strength sufficient.</p>

<p>She had formerly made me her confidant, and now she felt
that I should understand her real situation, and feel the deep
sympathy for her suffering which she craved. As I stood by
her bed, she took my hand in her own, so cold, emaciated,
and corpse-like, that it sent an involuntary shudder through
my frame, and said, in a whisper, “I am dying, for the want
of a little opium!”</p>

<p>Seeing me start, as though I would speak, she said,</p>

<p>“No! no! don’t tell them! They don’t know how I suffer
for the want of it; but you do, and you know how to pity
me. O! I would give the whole world, if it were mine, for
one little dose&mdash;yes, one little dose would be bliss to me!”</p>

<p>Ye who have hearts to feel for human woe, think, if you can,
what were my feelings, as I stood beside that bed, witnessing
such misery and hearing such language&mdash;well knowing, that
I could do nothing for her relief, nor say anything to influence
others to give her what she so much needed; and what, if
she had done wrong in taking so long&mdash;who will dare to say,
that it was right to withhold it from her, in that fearful emergency!
But it was withheld&mdash;and in a few days she died!</p>

<p>Would that I could present the picture of this woman’s
sufferings, to all those invalids in our land, who are beginning
to tamper with this deadly drug, which at last “biteth like
a serpent and stingeth like an adder!” Methinks they would
hasten to deliver themselves, as a roe from the hand of the
hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="THE_DIGESTIVE_ORGANS">THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS.</h2>


<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE is no part of the human system
which has such a controlling
influence over the whole body, as
respects health or disease, as the digestive
organs. Any derangement in these,
especially the stomach, calls up a sympathy
of action from the whole animal economy.
Nearly all the morbid actions found
in the general system, are produced from
causes, first operative on the stomach.</p>

<p>Hence, keeping the digestive system in
a healthy state, secures, as a general rule,
a healthy action in every other part of the physical
organization. Therefore, to know something
of the anatomy and physiology of the digestive organs,
together with the laws of digestion, seems indespensable for
every individual who would know how to take care of his
health. By the term “digestive organs,” is intended the
mouth, stomach, liver, and bowels, including the whole length
of this canal is a lining membrane, called the mucous mem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>brane,
which continues from the lips to the opposite extremity;
this membrane is filled through its whole extent with
minute blood vessels, and in some parts, abundantly supplied
with fine filaments of nerves. This membrane has important
functions to perform in the process of digestion; it is a membrane
of much delicacy of structure. Its healthy action is
easily deranged, and when impaired in one part, becomes, by
sympathy, deranged in every part.</p>


<h3>THE MOUTH.</h3>

<p>The mouth, with its teeth and glands, commences the
digestive process; the teeth are to masticate the food; the
salivary glands give important aid to digestion. There are
three pairs of glands, which pour the fluid they secrete, into
the mouth; this fluid is called saliva; the efforts of chewing
food excites these glands, and promotes the secretion of saliva,
which is essential to the healthy digestive process.</p>


<h3>THE STOMACH.</h3>

<p>The stomach is the most important organ of digestion. It
has three coats; that which has most to do with digestion is
the mucous coat, which lines it; this coat is supposed to furnish,
by its glands, what is called gastric juice, which is the
principal agent of digestion. The stomach is abundantly
supplied with nerves, and holds a very powerful sway over the
whole nervous system&mdash;so that, when the stomach is under
the influence of disease, either acute or chronic, the whole
system is immediately in a state of suffering. To secure,
then, a healthy organization, the stomach must be kept in
health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>


<h3>THE LIVER.</h3>

<p>This organ is also essential to digestion; it furnishes the
bile; it is the largest gland in the body, and its office seems
to be to gather from and carry out of the system substances
which, if retained, might prove hurtful. When the liver is
inactive, we have what is called the jaundice; the liver failing
to take up from the system that substance which forms the
bile. When this is the case, a yellow substance is found diffused
throughout the whole body, and it exhibits a yellow
tinge. The bile, when properly secreted and discharged,
meets the contents of the stomach as discharged into that
part of the bowels nearest the stomach, and is there supposed
to assist in the process of separating the nutritious part of the
contents from the refuse, which is to pass off by the bowels;
but its more important office is, doubtless, to rid the passage
of the refuse, or the fæces, by evacuation. The bile seems to
be nature’s appropriate stimulus to the bowels, without which
costiveness, and other irregularities, are likely to ensue.</p>


<h3>THE BOWELS.</h3>

<p>The bowels contain the absorbent vessels, which take up
the nutritious part of the food and carry it into the circulation
of the blood, for the support of the system; they also convey
the refuse part of the food out of the body.</p>


<h3>MASTICATION.</h3>

<p>Mastication, or chewing, is the first step in the process of
digestion. When food is taken, it should be thoroughly masticated,
before it is suffered to pass into the stomach, or it is
unprepared for the action of the gastric juice. Besides this,
the action of chewing causes the food to be mixed with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
saliva, which is an important item in the preparation of it for
the action of the stomach and its juice. The food should be
taken with sufficient moderation, to give time for the process
of mastication, and the discharge of saliva from the glands
of the mouth. Eating fast, or even talking while chewing,
besides its incongruity with politeness and good breeding, is
directly at war with thorough mastication.</p>

<p>Many persons seem to think, that hurrying their meals to
save time is economy; their business drives them, and they
drive their time of meals into the smallest possible compass.
This is miserable economy; for, when they hurry down their
food, half chewed and half moistened with saliva, it deranges
the process of digestion throughout, and, as a consequence,
the food not only sits bad on the stomach, and in time causes
dyspepsia, but fails to accomplish the sole object of taking it&mdash;the
nourishment of the body. In order to derive nourishment
from food, it must be well digested; hence it must be
well masticated. When, therefore, we hurry our eating, we
hasten our steps on the wrong road; time curtailed in eating,
is worse than hiring money at three per cent. a month. If
we cannot spare time to eat, we had better not eat at all; this
idea cannot be too deeply impressed upon the minds of all.
Thousands, by this kind of careless and reckless eating, have,
found themselves the victims of dyspepsia, and all its attendant
train of evils; the digestive organs may bear the abuse
awhile, without giving many signs of trouble, but the penalty
of that broken law must sooner or later come; and it may
come in the form of a broken constitution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>


<h3>CHYMIFICATION.</h3>

<p>Chymification, or the transformation of food into chyme, is
the most important step in the process of digestion. The
food, after mastication, passes into the stomach; here it is
formed into a homogenous mass, partly fluid and partly solid,
which is called chyme. What is the exact philosophy of this
process, has been a matter of some discussion, into which it
is not necessary now to enter; nor is it yet satisfactorily settled,
so as to admit of any definite instructions being given.
The theory which is now generally received, respecting the
manner in which the stomach acts upon food, is, that the
gastric juice possesses a solvent power, by which the food
becomes reduced to a uniform mass; the solvent power of the
gastric juice is very great in a healthy, vigorous stomach, but
varies in strength according to the energy of that organ. The
solvent power of the gastric juice is evidently controlled by
the vital principle of life; while the gastric juice of a healthy
stomach acts vigorously upon the hardest kinds of food; yet
sometimes, when it comes in contact with anything possessed
of the principles of life, its power is stayed&mdash;worms, while
living, are not affected by it, but when destroyed, are often
digested. The gastric juice also possesses the property of
coagulating liquid albuminous substances; the stomach of the
calf is used for this purpose, by the dairy-woman, in making
cheese; and when the infant throws up its milk, because the
stomach is too full, that milk will be more or less curdled&mdash;and
instead of considering this curdling an indication of disease,
it should be accounted a symptom of a good, healthy
stomach.</p>

<p>The time ordinarily occupied in the process of chymification,
when the food has been properly masticated, has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
found to be four or five hours; the three first hours of the
period, is occupied in the process of intermixing the food,
after it enters the stomach, with the gastric juice. After this
is accomplished, an alternation of contraction and expansion
of the stomach, or a kind of churning motion takes place,
and continues until the whole mass is converted into chyme,
and conveyed to the first intestines, or duodenum, to undergo
another change.</p>


<h3>CHYLIFACTION.</h3>

<p>Chylifaction, or the formation of chyle, is the next great
step in the process of digestion. This takes place in the
duodenum; the chyme from the stomach is let into the intestines
little by little; a valve at the lower opening, or outlet
of the stomach prevents it from passing any faster than it can
be disposed of, in the formation of chyle. This fluid is a thin,
milky liquid, extracted from the chyme, and then taken up
by absorbent vessels, called lacteals; the chyme passes slowly
through the duodenum, and, in doing so, becomes mixed with
another fluid furnished from the pancreas, or sweetbread, and
the bile from the liver; passing slowly through this large
intestine, ample time is given for the lacteal to take up all
that is valuable, to be carried into the circulation, for the
nourishment and support of the system. This chyle, taken
up by the lacteals, is directly converted into blood, and, in
many of its characteristics, it very closely resembles blood.
The process by which this conversion is carried on, is called
absorption; that class of absorbent vessels called lacteals, are
not only found in the first intestine, or duodenum, but are
distributed along the small intestines, for the purpose, as before
stated, of conducting the chyle in its appropriate course, for
the formation of blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></p>


<h3>EVACUATION.</h3>

<p>Evacuation, or the discharge of the refuse part of the food,
through the bowels, is another and the last step in the process
of digestion. This part of the subject has a very important
bearing on the condition of the health; it is impossible for
any one to possess good health, while this office of the bowels
is imperfectly performed. If the bowels are relaxed and
irritable, the food is borne along too soon and too rapidly;
this causes the process of chylification to be imperfect&mdash;the
chyle is imperfectly formed, and the lacteals have not sufficient
time to absorb it from the mass; this prevents the food from
nourishing the system. Hence, those who suffer from chronic
diarrhœa may eat largely, and yet grow weaker and weaker;
their food does not nourish them; the nutritious part passes
off through the bowels, instead of being taken into the blood.
If the bowels, on the other hand, are constipated, the consequences
are no less unhappy. No one can possibly be well
with costive bowels; the free and easy action of the bowels
is as truly essential to health, as the free circulation of the
blood. When the bowels are sluggish, the process of absorption
of the chyle is retarded; and what is absorbed, is less
pure and healthy, so the quality of the blood is impaired.</p>

<p>Besides the evils already mentioned, a costive state of the
bowels often causes a pressure of blood on the brain, and also
derangement of the nervous system, excitability of the nerves,
nervous headache, depression of spirits, and a long catalogue
of sufferings, too numerous for details. Habitual costiveness
impairs the tone of the stomach, and prevents its healthy
action; piles, also, with various degrees of severity, are often
caused, directly or indirectly, by constipated bowels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

<p>The causes of constipation are various, and to point them
out in detail would be, perhaps, a fruitless task. But there
is one cause, and a very common one, which claims attention
here; it is the habit of inattention to, and neglect of, the natural
promptings of the bowels to evacuate themselves. Thousands
on thousands, especially females, by a habit of checking
the natural inclination of the bowels to throw off their contents,
have brought upon themselves habitual costiveness,
which, in time, has cost them immense suffering and wretchedness.
No one should ever hold his bowels in check, if it
be possible to avoid it; it can readily be perceived, that doing
this would tend to diminish the natural effort of the bowels,
and to collect their contents into a solid mass; then, the exertion
required to empty the bowels, or the physic taken to aid
or make effectual that exertion, tends also to increase the difficulty.</p>

<p>A habit of costiveness should always be removed, if possible;
and the best way of doing this, is by a course of discipline.
Those articles of food should be selected, which have an
influence to keep the bowels open. Bread, made of flour, has
a tendency to constipate them; but brown bread, and bread
made of wheat meal, have a tendency to open them&mdash;also
molasses, taken with food, has an additional tendency; fruits
and greens, if the stomach can bear them, are adapted to
relieve costiveness. The influence of the mind should also
be brought to bear upon this difficulty; the operation of the
mind on the physical system is very great, especially in chronic
complaints.</p>

<p>A person with costive bowels, should have a mental determination
to have a natural evacuation of the bowels, at some
regular hour in the morning&mdash;just after breakfast should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
preferred. By a mental calculation, by bearing the subject in
mind, by thinking and desiring, by intending to have the
bowels move about that hour, very much may be done by
way of facilitating such a result. But if, instead of attending
to a favorable diet, and of thinking on the subject at the
proper time, we treat the difficulty with medicines alone, we
do harm rather than good: for the more alteratives we take,
the more we increase the trouble; the physic only overcomes
the constipation for the time, and afterward leaves the bowels
in a more torpid state. Still, rather than endure the consequences
of costiveness, it is better to take alteratives, in conjunction
with other means, until the difficulty can be removed.
When alteratives are used in conjunction with discipline, they
should be of the mildest kind. No proper pains should be
spared, in overcoming this derangement of nature, till a habitual
movement of the bowels once in twenty-four hours, is
secured.—<i>Coles, on Health.</i></p>

Then a basin of warm water and

of mothers and nurses. In the first place, as soon as it comes
into the world, it is laid under the bed or table, with little or
no care as to its exposure to the cold; next a little rag is used,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
with some fine scented soap, and it is dressed in a cold, gaudy
apparel&mdash;its comfort not considered&mdash;only the show of fine
clothes. You have not the least idea how much this little
creature suffers, and you are laying up trouble for yourself; I
believe a child that has no pain, never cries. What is the next
thing that is done? “Why, I must give it purgatives; the
child must have a dose; we must deprive the poor thing of
its senses, in order that it may rest;” then they dose it with
narcotics, and if, by chance, it lives to be a month old, they
take off its belly-band. Then comes feeding; a bowl of strong
bread and milk is prepared&mdash;and though the nurse or mother
has sufficient breast milk for it, they imagine the child craves
food, and the poor little creature is, as I may say, crammed
to death.</p>

<p>Why does the child cry? Perhaps, my dear friend, the
cause is your own fault&mdash;over dosing in the first place; be
cautious, as soon as the little one makes its entrance into this
world. Do as I directed before, then take a piece of fresh
butter the size of a bird’s egg, mix it up with loaf-sugar, put
a little piece at a time into the new-born infant’s mouth, and
it will suck it down; this will cleanse its mouth and alimentary
canal, and open all obstructions in the intestines. Let
the child have the breast as soon as possible; the first milk
will purge the infant sufficiently, without having recourse to
cathartics; by giving purgatives to an infant, it does more
harm than good. A child ought to be put at the breast as
soon as possible&mdash;it is a great error to keep the child from it
for several hours; and suppose the mother to be weak, it will
not injure her health in the least, as it is natural; but it is
unnatural to give the child strong bread and milk&mdash;give it a
little catnip tea, if it is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

<p>I have seen a mother, who imagined her child was hungry,
and she would have a cup of bread and milk on the stove all
day, and every few minutes she would give the child a teaspoonful;
if the little creature pushed it out with its tongue,
she would push it back with her finger. This is cruel; we
may call this mother over fond. A child should never have
any kind of food until six, or even nine months old, if the
mother has milk of her own; I never gave mine any until
they were to be weaned&mdash;in fact, I never allowed my eldest
son to have a mouthful of any food, except the breast, until
he was one year old; that day I commenced weaning him,
and gave him no drink through the night, except cold water;
I never gave my other children any drink but cold water, after
they were weaned. Feeding children at night is a foolish
habit.</p>

<p>Let them wear their belly-band at least until you put short
clothes on them; then have a waist to their petticoats, with
shoulder straps, buttoned behind the waist, made from their
arms to the hips; this supports the bowels; keep the same
on your girls for years; it would, if practicable, be well for
them to wear it all their lives, and we would not then see so
many young females afflicted with tumors and cancers in the
ovaries, nor the falling of the womb. I think babes’ dresses
ought not to be too long, as it draws too heavily; the weak
form cannot support it as easily as you imagine. Let me beg
of you to study their comfort and health. I love to see a
child well dressed, as well as any one&mdash;but I see too many
that suffer from the law of fashion rather than comfort, that
I pity them. Keep the feet warm with socks, and the head
cool, but not to extremes.</p>

<p>Great care should be taken in regard to bathing children;
always bathe them regularly every morning&mdash;but let the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
be warm; cold water will do more harm than good. In the
heat of summer let it be tepid&mdash;it will strengthen a child;
but when cold water seizes the little creature, it generally
produces too much fear to be beneficial.</p>

<p>When you intend to wean your infant, it would be well to
choose the shortest days, as the child will sleep more. A
good substitute for mother’s milk is arrow-root, boiled in half
milk and water. Avoid strong food; the least sugar you
give the better. If medicine is required, use Turkey rhubarb;
always buy the root, and prepare it yourself&mdash;do not get it
pulverized; cut it, and steep it as much as necessary; add a
few caraway seeds to it, when you steep it. This medicine
will not injure the child, in case you give too much, as would
any other cathartic, but it is strengthening to the bowels.</p>

<p>If the child has a sore mouth, get some pulverized wild
turnip and cranesbill bark; take two teaspoonsful of loaf
sugar, and as much of the barks as you can hold on a ten
cent piece; mix well, and put a little, two or three times a
day, into its mouth; give a little saffron tea and a little rhubarb.</p>

<p>If the child is chafed in the neck, or elsewhere, take pulverized
cranesbill bark, and put it into a muslin bag; when
you wash the child, dust this in all the parts affected; do it as
often as you think necessary.</p>

<p>If it has sores, wash with Castile soap, and get some pulverized
bloodroot, and mix it with two-thirds water and one-third
cider, and wash it; this alone will cure all sores. A
good medicine for children, in the spring, is composed of the
following: take half an ounce of the best sulphur, quarter of
an ounce each of cream tartar, pulverized yellow dock root,
tanzy, elecampane root, pulverized rhubarb root, one ounce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
black alder bark, a teaspoonful of mandrake root, and a tablespoonful
caraway seed; mix these with molasses, and let them
stand twenty-four hours, stirring it two or three times during
the day. Give according to age&mdash;a child two months old, a
piece the size of a bean; a child three years old, half a teaspoonful
in the morning, before dinner, and at bed-time; you
can begin with small doses, and increase as you think best.</p>

<p>The best way to cleanse the blood of an infant, when at the
breast, is for the mother to take the proper medicines and
purify her own blood; it will do the child more good, and
renew the milk. If your child is full of humors, you may be
sure they will increase; but do not wean it on that account&mdash;purify
your blood by taking the cleansing syrups mentioned
in this book; and, in case you do not understand how to mix
them, send to me for them, mentioning the age of the child,
and how the humor makes its appearance.</p>

<p>The seven years’ itch is very prevalent at the present day,
among all classes of society, from the highest to the lowest;
it is fashionably termed salt rheum, or a species of it. Children
are more or less troubled with the preaff, a species of ringworm;
use no ointments, externally, until the inside is well
guarded, or you throw it on the lungs, or in the joints, and
make it a fool or a cripple for life. So be wise and prudent.
Do not comb or scrape a baby’s head, if it has dandruff; wet
it with a little sweet or olive oil at night, the next morning
wash it carefully with Castile soap, and continue until all is
removed. Keep the infant’s ears well cleaned; always use a
soft brush for the hair.</p>

<p>Kind reader&mdash;I have endeavored to instruct you how to
secure good health for your children; allow your aged friend
to say a few words for the soul&mdash;which never dies, but returns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
to its Creator, God. Have you ever considered this important
truth? If so&mdash;happy soul! angels rejoice to see a mother
leading her babes to Jesus! As soon as they can lisp, teach
them to pronounce the name of Jesus, and to ask him to bless
them and you. Bow with them at the Throne of Grace,
morning and evening; be simple and short, in your requests
to your Heavenly Father, that it may be a pleasure, rather
than a task, to them.</p>

<p>Has death visited your abode, or fortune frowned upon you&mdash;go
to Bethlehem; there you will find the Blessed Virgin
Mary, the mother of your Savior&mdash;poor, outcast, and dejected,
seeking a shelter, to bring forth the God-man! Then
follow her to the Cross; here, a sword pierces her own soul,
to behold her only-beloved Son expire on the cross for ungrateful
man. But she had grace from on high; and we, too, can
have the same ark. Remember, this is not our abiding place;
Mary rejoiced, because she knew this, and her soul was filled
with love&mdash;no murmuring or complaint escaped her lips&mdash;all
was submission to the will of God! Let us all follow her
example; and join our dear babes in Heaven, as the mother
of our God and Savior did.</p>

every word. I would politely ask
such&mdash;cannot the aged be excused?

<p>It has been my determination, as far as practicable, to dispose
of the book myself, and only among my sex. I pray to
God it may be a blessing to the rising generation. I shall
always be happy to give you any information, in regard to
your health, by letter. After the first of May, 1858, you can
address to “Saint Vincent de Paul, Lower Canada,” nine
miles from the city of Montreal; and the first of June, I shall
be enabled to accommodate a few invalids, at my own house.
It is situated on a branch of the Ottawa, and commands a

<h2 id="THE_DIET_OF_CHILDREN">THE DIET OF CHILDREN.</h2>


<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_177d.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DURING the early stage of life, all
heating and stimulating food and
drinks should be strictly forbidden.
They tend more certainly to produce
disease, in the really excited system
during childhood, than perhaps at
any other period of life. Vegetables
should, in fact, constitute the
principal diet of children; especially
the farinaceous substances&mdash;such as
bread, rice, arrow-root, potatoes, &amp;c. To these may be added
milk, soft-boiled eggs, and a very moderate allowance of plain
and simply cooked animal food. Children, in general, have
very excellent appetites, and a sufficiency of nourishing food
is absolutely necessary&mdash;not merely to renew the waste of
their systems, but also to supply materials for their daily
growth.</p>

<p>Three, or perhaps four, light meals a day, will be found a
good allowance during childhood. At one of these&mdash;the
dinner, or mid-day meal&mdash;animal food may be allowed, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
moderation; for the others, bread, or potatoes, and milk, various
preparations of rice, or rice and milk, plain bread pudding,
and custard, form a proper and wholesome diet. All
salted and high-seasoned food should be forbidden. Some
have objected to butter for children; although experience
would appear to show that a very moderate allowance of fresh
butter is by no means injurious.</p>

<p>Of vegetables&mdash;potatoes, carrots, turnips, beets and cauliflowers,
will be found most wholesome. They should be well
boiled, and the potatoes and turnips eaten without being
mashed, or mixed with butter or fat gravy. Children should
never be indulged in pastry, of any kind. They may, occasionally,
take a little of the cooked fruit of a pie; but even
this should be in moderation.</p>

<p>The drink of children should be simply water, milk, whey,
or very weak tea, milk and sugar. All stimulating and fermenting
liquors are not only unnecessary, but positively injurious,
by increasing, to an improper extent, the circulation of
the blood; they induce fever, indigestion, inflammation, or
convulsions, to say nothing of the danger of their use during
childhood&mdash;giving rise to habits of intemperance in after life.</p>

<p>The period of the meals should be strictly regulated, and
in such a manner that the intervals between them should not
be so great as to permit the children to experience, at any
time, a sensation of hunger. Supper should be taken an hour
or two before bed-time. Children should get their breakfasts
as soon as possible after they have arisen, and have been
properly combed and washed; the stomach is then empty,
and the appetite keen. If food be too long withheld, the
cravings become either too importunate, or the appetite fails&mdash;either
of which would be injurious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>As little variety of food as possible should be set before
children; since every extraordinary article becomes a new
incentive to appetite. They should never be indulged with
a second course; if they sit down with an appetite, they will
satisfy it by eating of the first articles presented to them&mdash;hence,
all the rest is superfluous, and therefore injurious. If
the appetite be trifling, the less they eat at the time the better;
as by taking but little, the appetite will more certainly
return at the next meal. But should this instinct of nature
for an observance of moderation be neglected, or attempted
to be overcome by variety, repletion, with all its evils, will
follow. Instead of a renewed and healthy appetite following,
as would have been the case had the instinct been obeyed, it
will be found diminished, and most probably attended with
headache, fever, oppression, or even vomiting.</p>

<p>Children should not be allowed to eat frequently of bread
and butter, bread and molasses, cakes, or fruit, between meals,
for this will either destroy the regular appetite, or induce
them to eat too much. In the first case, the stomach will be
interrupted in its regular routine of function; consequently,
the appetite will become either irregular or capricious. In
the second case, all the evils attendant upon an over distension
of the stomach must follow. They should not, therefore,
be suffered to carry food in their pockets, to eat between
meals, or during school hours, as this produces the injurious
habit of requiring food at improper times; by which the
digestion of the previous meal is interfered with&mdash;a fresh quantity
of food being forced upon the stomach, before it has
properly digested that which had been before received.</p>

<p>Children are to be restrained from any violent exercise
immediately after dinner; if not kept in a state of perfect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
rest, they should at least be prevented from engaging in any
pastime which requires considerable bodily exertion. They
should also be early taught the importance of eating slowly,
and chewing their food well; on this account alone, the habit
of resting after a meal is of importance, as it prevents them
from swallowing their food hastily, in order that they may
return more quickly to their play.</p>

<p>In regulating the diet of children, care should be taken not
to force any particular article upon them, after it is found, by
a fair trial, not to agree with their stomach. The contrary
practice is both cruel and injudicious; cruel, because the poor
child is forced to swallow what is disagreeable to it; and
injudicious, because it is liable to perpetuate a disgust which
most probably would have subsided, had no forcible attempt
been made to overcome it. At the same time, however, great
care must be taken that permanent dislikes are not formed, at
this period of life, against certain wholesome articles of food.
This is often a matter of very great difficulty; a good deal
of close observation and discernment being required, in order
to distinguish between a wayward prejudice and an actual
disgust. The former, if indulged in too long, may be converted
into the latter; while the latter may often, by judicious
and well adapted means, be entirely removed. Children
should never be suffered to eat alone, unless the proper quantity
of food be meted out to them; otherwise, they will eat
too much. If a child demand more than is judged proper
for it, its importunities should always be resisted with firmness,
or it will certainly acquire habits of gluttony.</p>

<h2 id="REMARKS_ON_FOOD">REMARKS ON FOOD.</h2>


<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/p.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PROBABLY the best means of ascertaining
food best adapted to the human
stomach, has been given us by
Dr. Beaumont, in his experiments.</p>

<p>While stationed at Michilimackinac,
Michigan Territory, in 1822, in the
service of the United States, he was
called upon to take charge of Alexis
St. Martin, a young Canadian, eighteen
years of age, of good constitution
and robust health, who was accidentally
wounded by the discharge of a musket,
June 6th, 1822.</p>

<p>“The charge,” says Dr. Beaumont,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
“consisting of powder and duck-shot, was
received in the left side, at the distance of
one yard from the muzzle of the gun. The
contents entered posteriorly, in an oblique
direction, forward and inward, literally blowing
off inguments and muscles the size of a man’s hand, fracturing
and carrying away the anterior half of the sixth rib,
fracturing the fifth, lacerating the lower portion of the left
lobe of the lungs, the diaphragm, and also <i>perforating the
stomach</i>!”</p>

<p>On the fifth day, sloughing took place; lacerated portions
of the lung and stomach separated, and left a perforation into
the latter “large enough to admit the whole length of the
middle finger into its cavity; and also a passage into the
chest, half as large as his fist.” Violent fever and further
sloughing ensued, and for seventeen days, everything swallowed
passed out through the wound, and the patient was
kept alive chiefly by nourishing injections. By and by the
fever subsided, the wound improved in appearance, and after
the fourth week the appetite became good, digestion regular,
the evacuations natural, and the health of the system complete.
The orifice, however, never closed; and at every dressing
the contents of the stomach flowed out, and its coats frequently
became everted, or protruded so far as to equal in
size a hen’s egg; but they were always easily returned.</p>

<p>On the 6th of June, 1823, a year from the date of the
accident, the injured parts were all sound except the perforation
into the stomach, which was now two and a half inches
in circumference. For some months thereafter, the food could
be retained only by constantly wearing a compress and bandage;
but early in winter, a small fold or doubling of the
villous coat began to appear, which gradually increased till it
filled the aperture, and acted as a valve, so as completely to
prevent any efflux from within, but to admit of being easily
pushed back by the finger from without.</p>

<p>Here, then, was an admirable opportunity for experimenting
on the subject of digestion, and for observing the healthy
and undisturbed operations of nature, free from the agony of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
vivisections, and from the sources of fallacy inseparable from
operating on animals. Dr. Beaumont was sensible of its
value, and accordingly pursued his enquiries with a zeal, perseverance,
and disinterestedness, highly creditable to his character,
both as a man and as a philosopher.</p>

<p>Dr. Beaumont began his experiments in May, 1825, and
continued them for four or five months, St. Martin being then
in high health. In the autumn, St. Martin returned to Canada,
married, had a family, worked hard, engaged as a voyager
with the Hudson’s Bay Fur Company, remained there
four years, and was then engaged at a great expense, by Dr.
Beaumont, to come and reside near him, on the Mississippi,
for the purpose of enabling him to complete his investigations.
He came accordingly in August, 1829, and remained till March,
1831. He then went a second time to Canada, but returned
to Dr. Beaumont in November, 1832, when the experiments
were once more resumed, and continued till March, 1833, at
which time he finally left Dr. Beaumont. He now enjoys
perfect health, but the orifice made by the wound remains in
the same state as in 1824.</p>

<p>The following table exhibits the general results of all the
experiments made upon St. Martin, posterior to 1825; and
the average is deduced from those which were performed
when the stomach was considered, by Dr. Beaumont, to be
in its natural state, and St. Martin himself subjected to ordinary
exercise.</p>

<p>As a general rule, animal food is more easily and speedily
digested, and contains a greater quantity of nutriment in a
given bulk, than either herbaceous or farinaceous food; but,
apparently from the same cause, it is also more heating and
stimulating. Minuteness of division, and tenderness of fibre,
are shown, by Dr. Beaumont’s experiments, to be two grand
essentials for the easy digestion of butcher-meat; and the
different kinds of fish, flesh, fowl, and game, are found to vary
in digestibility, chiefly in proportion as they approach or
depart from these two standing qualities.</p>

<p>Farinaceous food, such as rice, sago, arrow-root, and gruel,
are also rapidly assimulated, and prove less stimulating to the
system than concentrated animal food. Milk seems to rank
in the same class, when the stomach is in a healthy state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span></p>

<p>Animal food, it is true, affords a more stimulating nutriment
than farinaceous and other kinds of vegetable aliment,
and hence it is avoided in diseases of excitement. But it
seems to me that this stimulus is owing, not only to its own
inherent properties, but also to its more highly concentrated
state, and to the much greater quantity of chyle which is
derived from it, than from an equal bulk of vegetable aliment.</p>

<p>Before concluding his experiments on the agents employed
in digestion, Dr. Beaumont made many observations, with a
view to ascertain whether any increase of temperature took
place during that process. By introducing a thermometer
with a long stem, at the external opening into St. Martin’s
stomach, both before and during the chymification, he succeeded
in obtaining very accurate information on this point.
In two or three of the experiments, the heat of the stomach
seemed to be increased after taking food; but in by far the
greater number, the temperature remained the same. It
appeared, however, that the variations of the atmosphere produced
a sensible change on the heat of the stomach&mdash;a dry
air increasing, and a moist air diminishing it. The ordinary
temperature may be estimated at 100 Fahrenheit, and in several
instances it was higher at the pyloric than at the cardiac
end. On one cloudy, damp, and rainy day, the thermometer
rose only to 94 degrees, and on another to 96 degrees; whereas
the next day, when the weather was clear and dry, it rose to
99 degrees; and on that following, when the weather was
both clear and cold, to 100. On several occasions, it rose as
high as 102 degrees, and once to 103 degrees; but these were
after exercise, which was always observed to cause an increase
of two or three degrees. We have already seen that artificial
digestion is entirely arrested by cold.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Inferences_from_Dr_Beaumont"></a>Inferences from Dr. Beaumont’s Experiments and
Observations, given in his own words.</span></h3>


<p>1. That hunger is the effect of distension of the vessels
that secrete the gastric juice.</p>

<p>2. That the processes of mastication, insalivation, and
deglutition, in an abstract point of view, do not in any way
affect the digestion of the food; or, in other words, when
food is introduced directly into the stomach, in a finely divided
state, without these previous steps, it is as perfectly digested
as when they have been taken.</p>

<p>3. That saliva does not possess the properties of an alimentary
solvent.</p>

<p>4. That the agent of chymification is the gastric juice.</p>

<p>5. That the pure gastric juice is fluid, clear, and transparent;
without odor, a little salt, and perceptibly acid.</p>

<p>6. That it contains free muriatic acid, and some other
active chymical properties.</p>

<p>7. That it is never found free in the gastric cavity; but it
is always excited to discharge itself by the introduction of
food or other irritants.</p>

<p>8. That it is secreted from vessels distinct from the mucous
follicles.</p>

<p>9. That it is seldom obtained pure; but is generally mixed
with mucous, and sometimes with saliva. When pure, it is
capable of being kept for months, and perhaps for years.</p>

<p>10. That it coagulates albumen, and afterward dissolves the
coagulæ.</p>

<p>11. That it checks the progress of putrefaction.</p>

<p>12. That it acts as a solvent of food, and alters its properties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

<p>13. That, like other chymical agents, it commences its
action on food as soon as it comes in contact with it.</p>

<p>14. That it is capable of combining with a certain and
fixed quantity of food; and when more aliment is presented
for its action than it will dissolve, disturbance of the stomach,
or “indigestion," will ensue.</p>

<p>15. That its action is facilitated by the warmth and motions
of the stomach.</p>

<p>16. That it becomes intimately mixed and blended with
the ingestæ in the stomach, by the motions of that organ.</p>

<p>17. That it is invariably the same substance, modified only
by admixture with other fluids.</p>

<p>18. That the motions of the stomach produce a constant
churning of its contents, and admixture of food and gastric
juice.</p>

<p>19. That these motions are in two directions&mdash;transversely
and longitudinally.</p>

<p>20. That no other fluid produces the same effect on food
that gastric juice does; and that it is the only solvent of aliment.</p>

<p>21. That the action of the stomach and its fluids is the
same on all kinds of diet.</p>

<p>22. That solid food, of a certain texture, is easier of digestion
than fluid.</p>

<p>23. That animal and farinaceous aliments are more easy
of digestion than vegetable.</p>

<p>We, the undersigned, have employed Madame Young, in

baffled eminent physicians. We cheerfully recommend her to
all afflicted.</p>

<p>Rochester, March 2d, 1854.</p>


<hr class="small" />
<p>This is to certify, that my daughter Maria, aged nine years,
was so afflicted with scrofula that her ears were eat through
into her head, and her face, neck, and head, was a mass of
corruption; she became blind, and had fits. I had employed
every skillful physician in this city, and elsewhere, and patent
medicine, to no avail. When Madame Young came into this
city, we were prevailed upon to try her medicine, as she had
wrought so many wonderful cures here. We employed her,
and, thanks be to my Heavenly Father, in two months my
beloved daughter was healed. Madame Young is a true
Christian&mdash;skillful in the healing art. We recommend her
to all afflicted, as the only sure way to health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span></p>

<hr class="small" />
<p>I hereby certify, that the treatment of Mrs. Young, with
roots, has done me much good; my stomach has been weak
for a great many years. Only fifteen days since, I commenced
using roots given me by said lady, and I am impelled to-day
to testify, that within twenty years I have not been as well&mdash;so
easy, so refreshed through my whole system. If I so testify,
it is because of my hope that many of the Rochesterians
will probably experience, as I do, the unutterable pleasure of
finding themselves, in a few days, restored from a weakly condition
of body, to the freshness of health. This reminds me
of what I was often told&mdash;namely, that the men of long bygone
days lived so long, because their thorough knowledge in
using these roots of the earth&mdash;simple, natural physics from
our bountiful God.</p>

<p>This may certify, that we, the subscribers, have employed
Madame Young in our families, in the treatment and cure of
various diseases; and that her management&mdash;particularly
in chronic diseases which had baffled the skill of the most
distinguished physicians&mdash;has been eminently successful, and
highly satisfactory. For several years we have been acquainted
with her character, and, knowing her to be worthy of confidence,
we cheerfully recommend her to those who may stand
in need of her services, as a truly devoted Christian and skillful
physician. For seven years she was presiding physician
over the Shakers’ Society at New Lebanon, N. Y.</p>

<hr class="small" />
<p>This is to certify, that my husband has been afflicted for
nine years with the asthma, and several physicians who have
attended him gave him over as past help, and must die of
consumption. He has been obliged to spend several hours, on a
cold winter’s night, with his breast upon the sill of the open
window, to get his breath. I have called my friends and
neighbors, as I supposed, to see him die. But, through the
instrumentality of Mrs. Young, and the blessing of Providence,
he has been restored to a comfortable state of health. “The
wind bloweth where it listeth; we hear the sound thereof,
and we cannot tell whence it cometh nor whither it goeth;
so is every one that is born of God.” And this seems the
case with Madame Young.</p>

<p>
Rochester, N. Y.</p>
<p class="psig"><span class="smcap">Ann Nurse, Francis Nurse.</span>
</p>

<hr class="small" />
<p>This may certify, that I was afflicted nine years with scrofula,
diseases of the throat and glands, in breathing&mdash;called
by physicians bronchitis, asthma, neuralgia, and six years with
tic doloreaux. Consulted twenty-two physicians, and have
been under the immediate care of fifteen, and I obtained no
permanent cure, but a little partial relief, which was not of
long continuance. All gave me up as incurable, and prescribed
only opium, internally and externally. At this time,
my friends concluded that before another year they must convey
me to an Insane Hospital for life, at the age of 32.</p>

<p>Thanks to my Heavenly Father, we heard of the many
blessings that had been conferred through the instrumentality
of Madame Young. As the last recourse we sent for her,
and she, with her indefatigable zeal for the relief of suffering
humanity, soon removed the cause, by renovating the blood;
and I am, after following her prescriptions three months, perfectly
well, and have not taken any medicine for one year. I
write this rather long testimonial, to encourage invalids to put
entire confidence in Madame Young, as she is truly pious, and
a skillful physician.</p>

<p>I certify, that my wife has been in a feeble state of health
for eight years; was at first attacked with typhus fever, and
brought very low. Since, according to the opinion of many
noted physicians, who have attended upon her, she has been
afflicted with the spinal disease, neuralgia, &amp;c., which baffled
their skill, and yielded not to their medicine. Six weeks
since she was again taken down with the typhus fever, and
was very much reduced, when she employed Madame Young.
She now enjoys a very good degree of health. The disease
which has so long afflicted her, with its attendant difficulties
has been made to yield, and she now enjoys the greatest of
temporal blessings&mdash;good health.</p>

<hr class="small" />
<p>This is to certify, that my wife has been in a state of ill
health for four years, with pains and a cough, and scrofula
internally and externally. Eminent physicians and patent
medicines were tried, to no avail. Finally, as medicine rather
irritated, we gave up, and concluded she must die. Hearing
of the many remarkable cures of our friends by Madame
Young’s syrups, we employed her, and I can in gratitude thank
my Heavenly Father that my wife is well, and can attend to
the duties of our family.</p>

<hr class="small" />
<p>With feelings of gratitude toward God, and for the benefit
of my own sex, I publish the following: In the year 1840,
I was taken with a pain in my spine, and faintness, had fits,
and my bowels were in a constipated state. I grew worse
daily, and new diseases came upon me&mdash;scrofula, chronic
rheumatism, with prolapsus uteri. Year 1848, I was unable
to help myself in the least. In March, 1848, I was recommended
to Madame Young, and as physicians had given me
up as incurable, I sent for her, as the last resource; and I can
say with truth, in less than five months I could go about and
attend to the duties of my family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></p>

<hr class="small" />
<p>It is with pleasure that I am permitted to add my testimony
to the many in favor of Madame Young, as possessed of
skill in determining the character of diseases and in applying
the remedy, especially such diseases as are common to females.
My wife was troubled with the prolapsus uteri, and scrofula
and dropsy for a number of years, and spent much time and
money in seeking relief from physicians, but found it not,
until, in the Providence of God, she was permitted to see
Madame Young, in whom she found a friend and physician
indeed, and was soon constrained to feel that there was “balm
in Gilead” for the afflicted. Suffice it to say, that she was
restored to that degree of health, which for years she had
been a stranger to. I can heartily recommend Madame Young
to all the afflicted of Adam’s race.</p>

Petersham, March 6, 1850.</p>
<p class="psig"><span class="smcap">Thomas T. Jenks.</span></p>

<hr class="small" />
<p>This may certify: I was afflicted with dropsy, was given up
by physicians as incurable; having had the canker rash and
measles four years previous, which had settled in my joints,
so that I could not bend them; pronounced by physicians,
rheumatic gout. I was also afflicted with shortness of breath,
spasms, &amp;c. At this time, I had a son troubled much with
diabetes. I was in despair of ever seeing my son well. When
Madame Young came to this village, Sept. 12th, I applied to
her; she attended my family three months, and I can say in
truth I have laid aside crutches and cane, and am able to do
a good day’s work on my farm; my son is restored to health,
thanks be to my Heavenly Father.</p>

<p>I recommend this truly good Samaritan to old and young,
as she never lost a child placed under her medical care, after
the physicians gave them up to die.</p>

<p>This certifies, that my daughter, Phebe A. Jones, aged four
years, has been severely afflicted with scrofulous affections in
the neck, so that her head was drawn on one side, thereby
causing much pain and suffering; and after being doctored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
and operated upon by the best physicians and surgeons in this
city, was given up by them as incurable, they not being able
to afford her the least relief.</p>

<p>I was recommended to Madame Young, who, in less than
eight weeks, cured her of every vestige of disease, and she
now enjoys the most perfect health. This certificate is given
in the hope that others afflicted may know where to find
relief.</p>

even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
